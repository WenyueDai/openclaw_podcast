In today’s roundup we spotlight a recent author correction from Nature Methods. The notice fixes a series of mis‑labelled figure citations and textual slips in the original paper on single‑cell multi‑omic detection of DNA methylation and histone marks. For example, the sentence about “z‑scoring CpG methylation per chromatin mark” was replaced with a direct comparison of methylation on nucleosomal versus linker DNA, and several extended‑data panels were swapped to match their legends. These tweaks matter because accurate figure references are the scaffolding that lets readers follow complex epigenomic arguments—especially when the study parses subtle differences like a 12 % shift in nucleosome‑wrapped CpG methylation versus 4 % in linker regions. The correction does not introduce new data, and the authors do not comment on whether any downstream statistics were altered, leaving a small uncertainty about the overall impact. One term worth a quick refresher: “sortChiC” blends cell sorting with chromatin‑interaction capture, enabling three‑dimensional genome maps in defined cell populations. All told, the amendment restores clarity without reshaping the paper’s core conclusions.
