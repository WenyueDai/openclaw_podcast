The United Nations has launched a new scientific advisory body on artificial intelligence, modeled explicitly after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The Independent International Scientific Panel on Artificial Intelligence was approved by the UN General Assembly on February 12, with only the United States and Paraguay voting against. The panel will produce annual reports synthesizing existing research on AI's economic, social, cultural, developmental, and safety impacts to inform global policymaking.

The panel consists of 40 members from 37 nations, appointed for three-year terms after a review of over 2,600 candidates by three UN technical agencies. Members serve in a personal capacity rather than as government representatives. The UN describes it as an "early-warning system and evidence engine" that will distinguish AI hype from reality by synthesizing existing research into "policy-relevant" reports.

Unlike the IPCC, which focuses primarily on climate science, this panel has a broader mandate covering multiple dimensions of AI's impact. Computer scientist Wendy Hall notes it is "much bigger in scope and is truly global" compared to previous initiatives like the Global Partnership on AI. AI governance expert Brian Tse emphasizes that it will cover topics beyond safety, similar to how the IPCC addresses various aspects of climate change.

The panel will not set policy or impose binding regulations itself. Instead, it aims to provide the scientific foundation that governments and international organizations can use to develop their own AI governance frameworks. This approach mirrors how IPCC reports have informed climate agreements without directly creating them.

The creation of this panel represents a significant step toward coordinated global governance of artificial intelligence, establishing a regular mechanism for synthesizing and communicating scientific understanding of AI's impacts to policymakers worldwide.

Imagine you're a policymaker trying to decide how much money to spend on scientific research. You need solid evidence about whether that investment actually pays off. But right now, that evidence is scattered across thousands of academic papers, making it nearly impossible to find clear answers when you need them. This is the problem that a new initiative called the Pop-Up Journal Initiative aims to solve.

The concept is elegantly simple: instead of permanent journals that publish whatever research comes their way, create temporary journals that focus on one specific, urgent question for just a few years. Think of it as a laser-focused research sprint rather than an open-ended publishing marathon. The first pop-up journal will tackle a question that comes up constantly in government circles: what's the economic return on investment in research and development?

Here's how it works. Organizations like research institutions or publishers compete to host these temporary journals. Once selected, they form a steering committee that coordinates the entire effort. This committee commissions specific research papers, coordinates projects, and ultimately produces summary essays that distill all the findings into actionable insights for policymakers. The initiative has secured $1 million in seed funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and Coefficient Giving, which will support both the host organizations and the researchers conducting the studies.

The timing seems right for this experiment. We're drowning in scientific publications - over 3 million papers are published annually. Critical evidence for policy decisions gets lost in this flood. Daniel Goroff, who's involved with the initiative, notes that questions about R&D returns come up constantly in high-level government discussions, from US Congress budget negotiations to international policy forums. Yet despite this persistent demand, we still lack clear, definitive answers because the historical data and methods are weak.

But here's the big question mark hanging over this entire concept: will researchers actually submit their work to a temporary journal instead of a permanent, prestigious one? That's the fundamental uncertainty. Researchers build careers on publications in established journals, and a pop-up title that disappears after a few years might not carry the same weight. The initiative's success hinges entirely on whether the scientific community embraces this new model.

There are other unanswered questions too. How will they ensure the steering committees select truly urgent and answerable questions? How will they measure whether policymakers actually read and use these summary essays? And perhaps most critically, can this model scale beyond a handful of journals while remaining financially sustainable?

The pop-up journal concept represents an intriguing experiment in bridging the science-policy gap. If it works, it could create a more efficient pipeline for delivering actionable evidence on high-stakes questions that governments face repeatedly but struggle to answer definitively. But its success depends on whether researchers are willing to trade the prestige of permanent journals for the focused impact of temporary ones. The initiative is betting that when faced with the choice between publishing anywhere and publishing something that might actually influence critical policy decisions, many researchers will choose the latter.

Scanning tunneling microscopy is one of the most powerful tools for probing electronic structure at the atomic scale, but a new study in Nature reveals how easily the technique can mislead researchers studying charge density waves. The work focuses on how experimental artifacts—not material properties—can dominate the signals researchers measure.

The core issue is that STM tip instability, piezo drift and creep, and inconsistent tip conditions create dramatic changes in both raw topographs and their Fourier transforms. In raw images, researchers observed horizontal noise lines from tip instability, drastic changes in lattice shape and intensity between successive scans, and substantial piezo drift that introduced artificial slopes and stretching into the topography.

The Fourier transforms tell an even more troubling story. When tip conditions change—for example, when a tip becomes double-tipped—the quasiparticle interference ring can disappear entirely, and impurity features change appearance. This means the same sample can look completely different depending on tip quality, even under identical experimental conditions.

Quantitatively, the problems are severe. Using 5x5 center-of-mass fitting to track Bragg peak positions and intensities, along with CDW signal strengths, researchers found large non-monotonic variations as laser illumination direction changed. Critically, scans taken with the same nominal illumination direction showed different results—for instance, scans d and e in the study exhibited different measured values despite identical conditions.

These artifacts matter because they can completely distort conclusions about directional dependence in CDW states. If tip instability or piezo creep changes your measured CDW intensity by 50% between scans, you can't attribute that change to the material's intrinsic response to laser illumination. The study emphasizes that researchers must rigorously assess data quality and tip stability, particularly when drawing conclusions about how materials respond to external fields or illumination.

The limitations are clear: tip instability introduces scan noise and alters apparent lattice structures; piezo drift creates artificial slopes and stretching; tip condition changes between scans make direct comparisons unreliable; and the analysis focused on problematic regions rather than providing a complete dataset picture. For anyone using STM to study field-induced responses or directional effects in quantum materials, this work serves as a crucial reminder that the microscope itself can be the source of the most dramatic signals.

A team led by Diana Farmer has completed the first clinical trial testing stem cell therapy for myelomeningocele, the most severe form of spina bifida, during fetal surgery. The Cellular Therapy for In Utero Repair of Myelomeningocele, or CuRE trial, involved six pregnant women carrying fetuses diagnosed with this condition. At 24 to 25 weeks gestation, surgeons performed a specialized in utero procedure where they applied stem cells derived from donated placentas directly onto the exposed spinal cords of the fetuses.

The primary goal was to assess safety, and the results show no complications during the surgeries on the mothers. After birth, all six newborns showed no signs of infection, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, or tumor formation. A major concern with stem cell therapies is the potential for cells to become cancerous, but this did not occur in any of the infants.

All six newborns also demonstrated reversal of hindbrain herniation, a condition where part of the brain descends and blocks cerebrospinal fluid circulation. This is a significant complication of myelomeningocele, and its reversal suggests the treatment may have therapeutic potential beyond just being safe.

Myelomeningocele causes severe paralysis and bladder and bowel dysfunction. Standard in utero surgery to close the spinal defect does not repair the neural damage caused by prolonged exposure to amniotic fluid, and nearly 60% of affected children cannot walk independently. This stem cell approach aims to directly repair that neural damage, offering a new strategy for a condition with lifelong disability.

However, the trial was very small, with only six participants, and was designed solely to test safety and feasibility, not to prove therapeutic benefit. It is too early to determine if the reversal of hindbrain herniation will translate into improved motor function or other long-term outcomes. Larger studies will be needed to assess efficacy and to understand the full potential of this approach.

Neanderthal dad, human mum: study reveals ancient procreation pattern

A new genomic analysis published in Nature reveals that female Homo sapiens mated with male Neanderthals more frequently than male H. sapiens mated with female Neanderthals. The evidence comes from examining three female Neanderthal specimens dated to 122,000, 80,000 and 52,000 years ago, all of which already contained some human ancestry.

The researchers compared the proportion of human-derived DNA across the Neanderthal genome, specifically contrasting the X chromosome with the non-sex chromosomes. They found that the Neanderthal X chromosome contained, on average, 62% more human DNA than the autosomes. This human DNA on the X chromosome was predominantly located in non-protein-coding regions of the genome.

This asymmetric pattern suggests that prehistoric social or behavioral patterns created measurable genetic signatures. The finding challenges a purely clinical view of ancient interbreeding by indicating that human social biases influenced genetic exchange. The researchers note that such patterns could result from mating preferences or from differential survival and reproduction of hybrid offspring with specific parental combinations.

The study's limitations include its small sample size of just three female Neanderthal individuals. The researchers cannot definitively distinguish whether the pattern resulted from a consistent mating preference, such as female H. sapiens choosing male Neanderthals, or from differential survival of hybrid offspring with specific parental combinations. The exact locations and potential functional impacts of the human DNA segments on the X chromosome are not detailed in the available text.

This research provides direct genetic evidence that prehistoric social patterns can create asymmetric signatures in ancient genomes, offering new insights into the complex dynamics of human-Neanderthal interactions during the period of their coexistence.

Here's what's new: a team of researchers has found that older adults with exceptional memory - so-called "super agers" - have surprisingly high levels of new neuron production in their brains, even into their 80s and beyond.

The study, published in Nature, analyzed post-mortem brain tissue from several groups: young adults, older adults with normal cognition, super agers, and people with cognitive decline or Alzheimer's disease. The researchers focused on the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for memory formation.

What they found was striking. Young adults and cognitively healthy older adults showed high levels of immature neurons - the hallmark of recent neurogenesis. But the super agers stood out even more. They had significantly more immature neurons than both the healthy older adults and the Alzheimer's group.

The numbers are worth noting. The new neurons made up only about 0.01% of total neurons in the hippocampus. That might sound tiny, but it's actually substantial for adult neurogenesis. For context, most adult brains produce far fewer new neurons, especially as we age.

The Alzheimer's group showed the opposite pattern - they had significantly fewer immature neurons compared to all other groups. This suggests a clear link between ongoing neurogenesis and preserved cognitive function.

Why does this matter? If we can understand what allows super agers to maintain such robust neurogenesis, we might be able to develop drugs that induce similar processes in other aging brains. This could potentially help prevent or treat cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease.

The study doesn't explain why super agers have this advantage. It could be genetic, lifestyle-related, or a combination of factors. But it does provide concrete evidence that the brain's ability to generate new neurons persists well into old age - and that this capacity correlates strongly with memory performance.

The available text does not provide details on the specific methods used to count neurons or the exact age ranges of the participants. It also doesn't discuss whether the super agers engaged in particular activities or had specific genetic markers that might explain their exceptional neurogenesis.

A single infusion of mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow has been shown to significantly improve physical endurance in older adults with frailty. In a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 118 participants aged 70 to 85 who were diagnosed with frailty received one of four different doses of stem cells, while 30 participants received a placebo. The primary outcome measure was the distance walked in a six-minute walk test, assessed before treatment and nine months after.

The results were striking. Nine months after a single intravenous infusion, participants who received the highest dose of stem cells walked an average of 60 meters farther in the six-minute walk test compared to their baseline performance. This represents a 20% improvement in walking distance. The stem cells used in the study are mesenchymal stem cells, which are known for their ability to differentiate into multiple tissue types, such as muscle and bone, and to secrete anti-inflammatory factors.

Frailty affects up to one-quarter of people over the age of 50, leading to increased vulnerability to falls, disability, and other health complications. The potential of a single stem cell infusion to improve endurance and quality of life in this population is significant. The study's design, with its placebo control and multiple dose levels, strengthens the evidence for the efficacy of this treatment.

While the study demonstrates a clear benefit in terms of physical endurance, the available text does not provide details on the long-term safety of the treatment, the mechanisms by which the stem cells exert their effects, or whether improvements in other aspects of frailty, such as cognitive function or overall quality of life, were observed. Further research will be needed to address these questions and to determine the optimal dosing and frequency of treatment. Nonetheless, this study, published in Nature, offers promising evidence that mesenchymal stem cell therapy could be a potent treatment for frailty in older adults.

Squeaking at soft-rigid sliding interfaces is caused by propagating opening pulses, not by traditional stick-slip oscillations. These pulses naturally occur at the shear wave speed of the soft material. Introducing thin surface ridges geometrically confines the pulses, transforming irregular two-dimensional dynamics into a coherent, one-dimensional pulse train that produces squeaking at a consistent, predictable frequency.

The study used experimental sliding tests with soft materials, such as rubber, sliding against a rigid surface. High-speed imaging was employed to visualize the interface dynamics and pulse propagation. Concurrent acoustic analysis was used to correlate the physical events with the emitted squeak sounds. Experiments compared flat samples to samples with engineered thin surface ridges.

For flat samples, opening pulses propagated irregularly across the interface at approximately the shear wave speed of the soft material and generated broadband, noisy acoustic emissions. Adding thin surface ridges confined the pulse propagation to a single dimension. This confinement yielded a consistent, regular repetition frequency of the pulses. The squeaking frequency produced matched the first shear mode resonance frequency of the sliding soft block, indicating the ridges stabilized the rupture dynamics.

This reveals a new, structure-driven mechanism for stabilizing frictional rupture and generating coherent sound at soft-rigid interfaces. It provides a fundamental physics-based explanation for common everyday squeaks, such as from shoes, chalkboards, or hip replacements, that previous stick-slip theories could not fully explain. The principle of using geometric confinement to control rupture dynamics could be applied to reduce unwanted noise in mechanical systems or to design materials with tailored acoustic signatures.

Here's a deep dive segment based on the provided notes:

This week in Nature, Alison Bashford reviews three upcoming books that span from the creases of our hands to the corridors of ancient diplomacy. Each tackles a different kind of mystery - biological, environmental, and historical.

First up is "Decoding the Hand" by Peter Mitchell, a deep dive into how humans have tried to read meaning into the lines on our palms. The book traces a fascinating history where palm creases became a battleground between science and pseudoscience. Mitchell highlights how geneticist Lionel Penrose in 1973 published correlations between unusual hand creases and genetic abnormalities - lending scientific credibility to what had long been the domain of palm readers. The book explores how physical anthropologists, psychologists, and even fingerprint experts became obsessed with the hand as a key to identity and health. As Bashford notes, it's a story of how the human body has been interpreted across centuries, from fortune-telling to forensic science.

The second book takes a far darker turn. "The Long Heat" confronts the grim reality that climate change mitigation has failed. The authors point to the stark 2023 statistic that the US extracted more oil and gas than any country ever had in a single year. With that as their starting point, they argue we must now consider three unpalatable options: massive adaptation to a hotter world, large-scale carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere, or solar geoengineering - deliberately blocking sunlight to cool the planet. It's a pessimistic but pragmatic look at where we stand after decades of insufficient action.

Finally, "Love, War, and Diplomacy" transports us to the 14th century BC through the Amarna letters - clay tablets covered in cuneiform script discovered in Egypt in 1887. These documents record diplomatic correspondence between Egyptian pharaohs like Akhenaten and other Near Eastern powers. As Bashford notes, they reveal what scholars consider the first international diplomatic system, providing unprecedented insight into ancient geopolitical relations.

What makes these books compelling is how each tackles fundamental questions - how we understand ourselves, how we face existential threats, and how we've navigated power across millennia. The available text doesn't provide details on the authors' specific methodologies or the depth of their arguments, but as Bashford presents them, these works promise to illuminate different facets of the human experience, from the personal to the planetary to the political.

Field-free full switching of octupole order is achieved in a Mn3Sn homo-junction by integrating symmetric and asymmetric driving forces, overcoming the need for perpendicular uniaxial anisotropy and achieving an order-of-magnitude improvement in switching efficiency.

The breakthrough centers on a homo-junction structure with a single-crystalline Mn3Sn(0001) bottom layer paired with a polycrystalline Mn3Sn top layer. The polycrystalline layer's tilted Kagomé geometry plays a crucial role - it decomposes the out-of-plane spin polarization from the bottom layer into two distinct components. One component acts perpendicular to the Kagomé plane (symmetric, antiferromagnet-type), while the other lies within the Kagomé plane (asymmetric, ferromagnet-type).

These two components generate complementary driving forces that work together in an unconventional switching protocol. The symmetric force accelerates octupole rotation, while the asymmetric force determines the switching chirality. This dual-force approach enables full switching at zero external magnetic field - a major advance since previous methods required applied fields or specific crystalline orientations.

The efficiency gains are substantial. The switching requires an order of magnitude lower current density and power consumption compared to previous configurations. This dramatic improvement stems from two factors: the intrinsic spin-torque characteristics of octupole order and an ultralow energy barrier created by the material's easy-plane anisotropy.

The zero-field switching capability demonstrates programmable chirality and robustness to external magnetic fields. This addresses a critical limitation that has prevented chiral antiferromagnets like Mn3Sn from being practical for memory applications. The approach combines the speed and robustness advantages of antiferromagnets with the deterministic switching behavior typically associated with ferromagnets.

However, several practical questions remain unanswered in the available text. The scalability of fabricating polycrystalline top layers at nanoscale device dimensions is not addressed. Long-term reliability data, including endurance cycling and thermal stability of the switched states, is missing. While the efficiency improvement is described as "an order of magnitude," specific quantitative values for current density, power consumption, or switching speed compared to previous work are not provided. The precise microscopic mechanism linking the tilted Kagomé geometry to spin polarization decomposition is described conceptually but lacks detailed quantitative modeling or imaging evidence.

This work represents a significant step toward practical antiferromagnetic memory devices by solving the field-free switching challenge through clever exploitation of material geometry and octupole order physics.

Researchers have developed a compact cavity-based set-up that uses highly reflective mirrors to amplify X-ray laser pulses, shrinking the required facility length from kilometres to just 66 metres. This breakthrough, reported in Nature, could make high-intensity X-ray sources far more accessible for scientific and medical applications. By creating a resonant cavity that enhances X-ray amplification, the team achieved coherent, monochromatic X-ray output without the massive infrastructure of traditional X-ray free-electron lasers. The innovation promises to lower costs and expand access to powerful X-ray tools for probing atomic-scale structures in proteins and materials.

A new study in Nature provides fresh evidence for the hygiene hypothesis, showing that environmental exposure to specific allergy-triggering molecules shapes how the immune system develops allergic responses. Researchers found that mice raised in different environments exhibited distinct patterns of allergic reactions, suggesting that early-life microbial and allergen exposure trains the immune system to regulate itself. This work offers mechanistic insight into why modern, ultra-clean living conditions may contribute to rising allergy rates. The findings could inform strategies to prevent or manage allergies by modulating environmental exposures during critical developmental windows. The study was published in Nature on February 25, 2026.

The familiar squeak of basketball shoes on a polished court comes from rapid, wave-like deformations sweeping across the shoe sole at speeds up to 300 kilometres per hour, according to a study in Nature. Using high-speed optical imaging, researchers visualized how these waves lift the shoe off the floor at localized points, enabling sliding. The repetition rate of the waves—and thus the pitch of the squeak—depends on the sole's stiffness and thickness. This finding explains why different shoes produce different squeaks and why the sound is so consistent on smooth courts. The work sheds light on the physics of everyday sports sounds, though broader implications or limitations were not discussed in the summary.

This correction notice from Nature addresses an error in the original article about HMGN1's role in heart defects linked to trisomy 21. The authors have revised the text to clarify that HMGN1 overexpression in Down syndrome disrupts normal heart development by altering chromatin accessibility and gene expression in cardiac cells. The correction ensures the findings accurately reflect how this protein contributes to congenital heart defects in individuals with Down syndrome. The study highlights HMGN1 as a potential therapeutic target for preventing or treating these heart abnormalities.

A close relative of animals has been found to use both major pathways to multicellularity, overturning the long-held belief that these routes are mutually exclusive. The choanoflagellate *Choanoeca flexa* can form multicellular structures either by cells joining together from different individuals or by cells remaining attached after division, and it can even combine both mechanisms in a single life cycle. This discovery, reported in *Nature*, challenges a fundamental assumption in evolutionary biology about how complex multicellular life originated. If the two primary pathways to multicellularity can be integrated, it suggests greater evolutionary flexibility in the emergence of complex organisms, including the ancestors of animals.

In a rebuttal published in Nature, researchers challenge claims that electric and magnetic fields cannot tune charge-density-wave states in kagome metals. Using scanning tunneling microscopy on RbV3Sb5, they demonstrate that laser-induced electric fields can control the relative intensities of CDW peaks in Fourier-transformed topographies, accompanied by changes in Bragg vector ratios. The team replicated previously observed magnetic field effects on the CDW state, directly contradicting assertions that these electronic order parameters remain unaffected by external fields. This work suggests a pathway to actively manipulate correlated electron systems in kagome metals, with implications for understanding and controlling exotic electronic states in these materials.

Researchers have engineered lipid nanoparticles to deliver therapeutic RNA specifically to the pancreas, overcoming the particles' natural tendency to accumulate in the liver. This breakthrough, reported in Nature, opens new possibilities for treating currently incurable pancreatic diseases. The engineered nanoparticles successfully targeted specific cell populations in the pancreas that were previously inaccessible to this delivery system. By redirecting these drug-carrying particles to the pancreas, scientists can now explore therapies for conditions that have lacked effective treatment options. This development represents a significant advance in targeted drug delivery, potentially enabling new approaches to treating serious pancreatic disorders through RNA-based therapeutics.

This paper from Nature - Protein Design explores a novel approach to data storage using unnatural proteins expressed in E. coli bacteria. While the available text doesn't include the main scientific content, we can piece together what this research likely involves based on the title and context.

The core innovation appears to be using engineered proteins as a medium for storing digital information. This builds on the concept of DNA data storage, where genetic sequences encode binary data, but takes a different approach by using proteins instead. The use of E. coli as an expression system suggests the researchers are leveraging biological machinery to produce these unnatural proteins at scale.

What makes this particularly interesting is the patent application mentioned in the competing interests section. Several authors are listed as inventors on a patent titled "Data storage using proteins," which indicates they've developed a specific method for encoding and retrieving data using protein sequences. This could represent a significant advance in alternative data storage technologies, especially as the world grapples with massive data growth and the limitations of traditional silicon-based storage.

The choice of proteins over DNA for data storage might offer advantages in terms of stability, density, or retrieval speed. Proteins can have more complex structures than DNA's simple double helix, potentially allowing for more sophisticated encoding schemes. Additionally, protein-based storage might be more compatible with certain types of biological or chemical processing systems.

However, without access to the full paper, many details remain unclear. We don't know the specific types of unnatural proteins used, the encoding scheme employed, the storage density achieved, or the retrieval methods. The efficiency of writing and reading data, error rates, and long-term stability of the stored information are also unknown.

This research sits at the intersection of synthetic biology, information theory, and materials science. If successful, protein-based data storage could offer a biologically-inspired alternative to current storage technologies, potentially with advantages in energy efficiency, longevity, or integration with biological systems.

The Creative Commons license mentioned suggests the authors intend for their work to be widely accessible, which is encouraging for the field's development. As data storage needs continue to grow exponentially, innovative approaches like this one could become increasingly important for addressing the limitations of current technologies.

Intermittent fasting is known to trigger a range of metabolic and immune changes, but a new study in Nature reveals a surprising and potentially concerning effect: it can evict long-lived plasma cells from their survival niche in the bone marrow. These plasma cells are the immune system's long-term antibody factories, responsible for maintaining protective antibody levels for months or even years after vaccination or infection.

The research, conducted in mouse models, shows that intermittent fasting disrupts the bone marrow microenvironment that normally supports these cells. Plasma cells rely on specific survival signals from stromal cells and other niche components to persist over the long term. When fasting alters the metabolic state of the bone marrow—likely through changes in nutrient availability, cytokine signaling, or niche cell function—these survival signals weaken. As a result, long-lived plasma cells are no longer retained and are instead lost from the bone marrow.

This eviction has direct consequences for humoral immunity. Since these plasma cells are the primary source of sustained antibody production, their loss leads to a decline in protective antibody levels. In the context of vaccination, this could mean that intermittent fasting might reduce the duration of immunity conferred by vaccines, as the long-lived plasma cells that would normally maintain antibody titers are prematurely cleared.

The study highlights a previously underappreciated interaction between dietary patterns and immune memory. While intermittent fasting has been associated with various health benefits, including metabolic improvements and reduced inflammation, this finding suggests a trade-off: the same metabolic shifts that may be beneficial in some contexts could undermine long-term antibody protection. This is particularly relevant for populations relying on vaccine-induced immunity, such as older adults or those with limited access to booster shots.

The available text does not provide details on the specific fasting regimen used, the duration of fasting periods, or whether the effects are reversible upon refeeding. It also does not specify which vaccines or pathogens were studied, or whether the findings translate directly to humans. However, the core discovery—that intermittent fasting can evict long-lived plasma cells from their bone marrow niche—opens new questions about how dietary interventions might be optimized to support, rather than compromise, long-term immune protection.

A new study in Protein Science reveals that the endoplasmic reticulum plays a previously underappreciated role in directing mitochondrial proteins to their correct locations within neurons. The research highlights how ER-mitochondria contact sites serve as critical hubs for protein trafficking, particularly in the complex architecture of neuronal cells. This organelle crosstalk ensures proper distribution of mitochondrial proteins across the extensive neuronal network, with implications for understanding neurodegenerative diseases where protein targeting goes awry. The findings suggest that disruptions in ER-mitochondria communication could contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction in conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.

Understanding these processes is crucial for improving the design and application of de novo proteins in therapeutic and research settings. The findings underscore the importance of considering chemical degradation pathways when developing stable, long-lasting protein-based tools.

The researchers developed a sequential workflow that integrates dynamic structural modeling to better capture the quantitative binding affinities of potential epitopes.

The rapid emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with spike protein mutations has undermined the effectiveness of current vaccines, necessitating innovative strategies to ensure broad and lasting immunity. This study leverages an immunoinformatics approach to design two multi-epitope vaccine constructs, Cov19-B and Cov19-T, targeting the spike protein's most notable mutations.

The spike protein is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies, but its high mutation rate allows the virus to evade immune responses. The researchers focused on conserved and variant-specific epitopes to maximize cross-protection. Cov19-B is a 649-amino-acid construct with a molecular weight of 74 kilodaltons, while Cov19-T is smaller at 465 amino acids. Both designs incorporate multiple B-cell and T-cell epitopes predicted to bind a wide range of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, ensuring population-wide coverage.

The immunoinformatics pipeline involved epitope prediction from spike protein sequences of dominant variants, including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron lineages. The team used algorithms to assess antigenicity, allergenicity, and toxicity, filtering for epitopes with high population coverage and strong binding affinity to MHC class I and II molecules. The final constructs were designed with linkers and adjuvants to enhance stability and immunogenicity.

In silico analyses suggest both vaccines could elicit robust humoral and cellular responses. Cov19-B, being larger, includes more epitopes and may offer broader protection, while Cov19-T's smaller size could simplify production and delivery. Neither construct has been tested in vivo yet, so efficacy and safety remain theoretical at this stage.

This approach addresses a critical gap: current vaccines are based on the original Wuhan strain and struggle against newer variants. By incorporating epitopes from multiple variants, these designs aim to provide durable immunity even as the virus evolves. The next steps would involve experimental validation, but the computational groundwork here offers a promising framework for next-generation COVID-19 vaccines.

Graph Neural Networks have emerged as a central methodology for modeling biological systems where entities and their interactions form inherently non-Euclidean structures. From protein interaction networks and gene regulatory circuits to molecular graphs and multi-omics integration, the relational nature of biological data makes GNNs particularly well-suited for capturing complex dependencies that traditional machine learning approaches struggle to represent.

The fundamental innovation of GNNs lies in their ability to operate directly on graph-structured data. Unlike conventional neural networks that assume grid-like or sequential data, GNNs leverage message-passing mechanisms where nodes aggregate information from their neighbors to update their own representations. This iterative process allows the network to capture both local and global structural patterns within biological networks.

In bioinformatics, GNNs have been applied across multiple domains. For protein structure prediction, graph-based representations capture the spatial relationships between amino acids, enabling models to learn from the three-dimensional folding patterns. In drug discovery, molecular graphs represent atoms as nodes and chemical bonds as edges, allowing GNNs to predict properties like binding affinity or toxicity. Gene regulatory networks benefit from GNN architectures that can model the complex regulatory relationships between transcription factors and target genes.

The survey highlights several key architectural innovations that have driven GNN performance in biological applications. Graph Convolutional Networks extend the convolution operation to irregular graph structures, while Graph Attention Networks learn to weight the importance of different neighbor nodes during message passing. Graph Transformers adapt the self-attention mechanism to graph data, and Graph Autoencoders enable unsupervised learning of meaningful graph representations.

A critical aspect of successful GNN applications in bioinformatics is the construction of appropriate biological graphs. Protein-protein interaction networks require careful consideration of interaction confidence scores and temporal dynamics. Molecular graphs must encode chemical properties and stereochemistry. Multi-omics integration demands architectures that can handle heterogeneous data types while preserving biological relationships.

The review identifies several emerging trends shaping the field. Attention mechanisms are increasingly being incorporated to allow models to focus on the most relevant biological features. Explainable AI techniques are being developed to interpret GNN predictions in biological contexts, addressing the black-box nature of deep learning. Multi-modal learning approaches combine GNNs with other architectures to integrate diverse data sources like imaging, sequencing, and clinical data.

Despite significant progress, challenges remain. Biological graphs often exhibit extreme sparsity and heterogeneity, requiring specialized architectures. The interpretability of GNN predictions in biological contexts remains an active research area. Scaling GNNs to massive biological networks while maintaining computational efficiency poses ongoing technical challenges.

The survey emphasizes that GNNs represent a paradigm shift in how we model biological systems. By embracing the inherent graph structure of biological data rather than forcing it into Euclidean representations, GNNs unlock new possibilities for understanding complex biological phenomena. From predicting protein functions to discovering novel drug candidates, GNN-based approaches are transforming multiple areas of bioinformatics research.

Monoclonal antibodies are one of the fastest-growing sectors in biopharmaceuticals, prized for their high therapeutic efficacy and reduced side effects compared to conventional treatments. But their production is expensive, and a major cost driver is the separation and purification process. Here's where things get tricky: the very steps meant to isolate these antibodies can actually damage them.

During chromatographic purification—whether it's affinity, ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, or multimodal chromatography—monoclonal antibodies are exposed to unique microenvironments. These include high salt concentrations, extreme pH shifts, and interactions with chromatographic resins. These conditions can trigger conformational changes in the antibodies, causing them to unfold or aggregate. And that's a problem, because these structural changes can compromise the product's quality, increase manufacturing costs, and even raise the risk of immunogenicity—meaning the patient's immune system might react to the drug.

This isn't just a theoretical concern. A comprehensive review of the literature from 2000 to 2025 shows that conformational instability during chromatography is a well-documented issue. Researchers have used a range of analytical tools to detect these changes, from spectroscopic methods to aggregation assays. The review also highlights various strategies to mitigate these risks, such as optimizing buffer conditions, controlling flow rates, and selecting resins that minimize harsh interactions.

What's striking is that while the biopharmaceutical industry has made huge strides in antibody engineering and production, the purification step remains a bottleneck—not just for efficiency, but for maintaining the structural integrity of the final product. So, as demand for monoclonal antibodies continues to rise, so does the urgency to refine these processes. The bottom line: ensuring the stability of these drugs during purification isn't just about quality control—it's about making these life-saving therapies safer and more affordable for patients.

Neurocysticercosis is the most common helminthic parasitic disease affecting the human central nervous system and is pleomorphic in its presentation. It is frequently encountered in daily practice in most parts of the world, and also commonly seen in industrialized countries in immigrant populations. In the past decade, new treatment (combined anti-parasitic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-epileptic drugs) has been shown to be superior to anti-parasitic drugs alone. However, the optimal treatment for neurocysticercosis remains controversial. The available text does not provide details on the specific drugs or treatment protocols used in the studies mentioned.

PIM kinases are serine-threonine kinases that regulate key cellular processes like proliferation, apoptosis, and metabolism through phosphorylation of multiple substrates. They've emerged as important therapeutic targets for cancer treatment, particularly because PIM-1 is often overexpressed in hematological malignancies and solid tumors.

The challenge in developing PIM-1 inhibitors has been finding compounds that maintain high potency while offering novel structural scaffolds that could potentially overcome resistance mechanisms or improve drug-like properties. Most existing PIM-1 inhibitors share similar structural motifs, which limits the chemical space available for optimization.

In this work, researchers employed a scaffold-hopping strategy starting from Amgen's compound C28, which has a quinazolinone core structure. The key innovation was using the PIM-1/C28 co-crystal structure to guide systematic modifications. They performed a ring-opening of the quinazolinone followed by a ring-closing operation between the benzene and pyrrole rings, creating an entirely new pyrroloquinoline scaffold.

This approach yielded three series of compounds - A1 through A5, B1 through B8, and C1 through C8. The most promising compound, designated C2, demonstrated exceptional potency with an IC50 of 33.02 ± 1.31 nanomolar against PIM-1 kinase. This represents a significant improvement over the starting scaffold.

Beyond enzyme inhibition, compound C2 showed favorable in vitro antitumor activity against the MM.1S hematological tumor cell line, with an IC50 of 1.87 micromolar. This dual activity - both as a potent kinase inhibitor and as an anticancer agent in cellular assays - validates the scaffold-hopping approach.

The success of this strategy demonstrates how structural biology can guide the design of novel chemical scaffolds that maintain or improve upon the activity of existing leads while potentially offering advantages in terms of selectivity, pharmacokinetics, or resistance profiles.

Nanoparticle-based drug delivery to the brain has been a major challenge for years. The blood-brain barrier, along with other biological obstacles, makes it extremely difficult for drugs to reach their intended targets without accumulating in off-target organs. But a new review in Drug Delivery and Translational Research highlights a promising approach: peptide-functionalized nanoparticles.

The core idea is to use peptides as targeting ligands on the surface of nanoparticles. These peptides act like molecular keys, helping the particles cross biological barriers and home in on specific brain regions. The review focuses on several well-studied peptides, including RVG29, T7, Angiopep-2, and mApoE. Each of these has unique properties that make them effective for brain targeting.

For example, RVG29 is derived from the rabies virus glycoprotein and has a strong affinity for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on neurons. This makes it particularly useful for targeting the central nervous system. T7, on the other hand, is a shorter peptide that can bind to transferrin receptors, which are highly expressed on brain capillary endothelial cells. Angiopep-2 is another transferrin receptor-targeting peptide, but it's been shown to have even better brain penetration than T7 in some studies. mApoE is a fragment of apolipoprotein E, which is involved in lipid transport and has been used to target brain cells via low-density lipoprotein receptors.

The review emphasizes that these peptides can be conjugated to various types of nanoparticles, including liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, and inorganic particles. This versatility allows researchers to tailor the delivery system to the specific drug and therapeutic goal. The peptides not only help the nanoparticles cross the blood-brain barrier but also reduce off-target accumulation, which is a common problem with conventional drug delivery.

One of the key takeaways is that peptide-functionalized nanoparticles represent a significant step forward in brain-targeted therapeutics. They offer a way to deliver drugs more precisely and efficiently, potentially improving treatment outcomes for conditions like brain tumors, neurodegenerative diseases, and stroke. However, the review also notes that challenges remain, such as optimizing peptide density on the nanoparticle surface and ensuring long-term stability in the bloodstream.

In summary, peptide-functionalized nanoparticles are emerging as a powerful tool for brain-targeted drug delivery. By leveraging the unique properties of peptides like RVG29, T7, Angiopep-2, and mApoE, researchers are making strides toward more effective and selective therapies for some of the most challenging diseases of the brain.

When the COVID-19 pandemic began, three vaccine platforms were authorized in the United States: two mRNA vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, and one adenovirus-vectored vaccine from Johnson & Johnson. Until now, no study had directly compared the immune responses these vaccines generate at the single-cell level. This new work fills that gap by tracking how innate immune cells, especially myeloid cells, respond to each platform over time.

The researchers collected blood samples from healthy adults before vaccination and at multiple timepoints afterward. They used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile the transcriptomes of immune cells, focusing on monocytes, dendritic cells, and other myeloid populations. They also measured cytokine levels in plasma and tracked the development of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

One of the clearest findings was that the adenovirus-vectored vaccine triggered a stronger and more sustained interferon response in myeloid cells than either mRNA vaccine. This interferon signature peaked around day seven after vaccination and was dominated by type I interferons like IFN-α and IFN-β. In contrast, the mRNA vaccines produced a milder, more transient interferon response that was largely gone by day seven.

The dose of mRNA also mattered. The higher-dose Moderna vaccine (100 micrograms) induced a slightly stronger interferon signature in myeloid cells than the lower-dose Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (30 micrograms), though both were weaker than the adenovirus response. This suggests that the magnitude of the innate immune activation scales with antigen dose for mRNA platforms.

Interestingly, the interferon response did not correlate with the strength of the later antibody response. All three vaccines generated robust neutralizing antibody titers by four weeks, regardless of the initial interferon signal. This indicates that while innate immune activation differs by platform and dose, the adaptive immune system can still mount strong protection through other pathways.

The study also found that the adenovirus vaccine induced a unique population of activated monocytes that expressed high levels of interferon-stimulated genes. These cells were largely absent after mRNA vaccination. Whether this distinct innate response affects long-term immunity or side effect profiles remains an open question.

By providing a high-resolution map of early immune events after COVID-19 vaccination, this work helps explain why different vaccine platforms can achieve similar clinical outcomes through divergent biological routes. It also sets the stage for designing next-generation vaccines that balance innate activation with tolerability.

Liver fibrosis is a major global health problem, and while chimeric antigen receptor macrophages or CAR-Ms have shown promise in targeting fibrotic tissue, their limited anti-inflammatory capacity has been a bottleneck. A new study in Nature Communications tackles this by engineering CAR-Ms with an additional protein called TRIM13, which enhances their ability to suppress inflammation and promote tissue repair.

The innovation here is twofold. First, the researchers developed a new type of lipid nanoparticle called ESLNPs, which are designed to respond to reactive oxygen species, or ROS, that are abundant in fibrotic liver tissue. These nanoparticles are made with a novel ionizable lipid and a helper lipid that exposes phosphatidylserine in ROS-rich environments, allowing for targeted delivery of mRNA to macrophages in the fibrotic niche.

Second, the mRNA payload encodes both a CAR that targets activated hepatic stellate cells—the main drivers of liver fibrosis—and TRIM13, a protein known to regulate inflammation and cell survival. By delivering both to macrophages in situ, the researchers could reprogram these cells to become more anti-inflammatory and more effective at clearing fibrotic cells.

In mouse models of liver fibrosis, this approach led to a significant reduction in fibrotic markers and improved liver function compared to standard CAR-M therapy. The ESLNPs showed better targeting and lower off-target effects than previous delivery systems, and the addition of TRIM13 helped sustain the anti-inflammatory phenotype of the engineered macrophages.

This work represents a meaningful advance in the field of cell therapy for liver disease, combining targeted nanoparticle delivery with genetic reprogramming to overcome a key limitation of CAR-Ms. It also highlights the potential of in situ engineering—modifying cells directly within the body—rather than relying solely on ex vivo manipulation. While further studies are needed to confirm safety and efficacy in humans, this strategy could open new avenues for treating not just liver fibrosis, but other inflammatory and fibrotic diseases as well.

Rheumatoid arthritis and type 2 diabetes mellitus are both chronic inflammatory diseases, and recent evidence suggests they share more than just inflammatory pathways. This study set out to uncover the shared gene signatures between the two conditions using integrated transcriptomic and bioinformatic analyses, with the ultimate goal of identifying potential drug repositioning opportunities.

The researchers began by collecting gene expression data from publicly available datasets, focusing on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with RA, T2DM, and healthy controls. They applied differential expression analysis to identify genes that were significantly altered in both diseases compared to healthy individuals. This yielded a set of overlapping differentially expressed genes—genes that were dysregulated in both RA and T2DM.

Next, they performed functional enrichment analysis on these shared genes. The results pointed to several key biological processes and pathways that were commonly disrupted. Notably, pathways related to immune response, cytokine signaling, and metabolic regulation were highly enriched. This aligns with the known inflammatory nature of both diseases and suggests that the molecular crosstalk between immune dysfunction and metabolic imbalance may be a central feature of their comorbidity.

To further explore the molecular landscape, the team constructed protein-protein interaction networks for the shared genes. This network analysis revealed hub genes—highly connected nodes that could serve as critical regulators or therapeutic targets. Among the top hub genes identified were several involved in inflammatory signaling, such as TNF, IL6, and various chemokine receptors.

The study then leveraged these findings for drug repositioning. By mapping the shared gene signatures to known drug targets and using connectivity mapping approaches, they identified existing drugs that could potentially modulate the shared molecular pathways. Some of the candidates included anti-inflammatory agents and drugs already approved for metabolic disorders, suggesting a rationale for repurposing them in patients with both RA and T2DM.

One of the strengths of this approach is that it moves beyond traditional single-disease drug discovery by exploiting the molecular overlap between comorbid conditions. This could accelerate the development of therapies that address both diseases simultaneously, potentially improving outcomes for patients who suffer from both RA and T2DM.

However, the study is not without limitations. The available text does not provide details on the specific datasets used, the exact number of shared genes identified, or the full list of drug candidates proposed. Additionally, while the bioinformatic predictions are promising, they will require experimental validation in cellular and animal models before any clinical translation can be considered.

In summary, this work demonstrates how integrating transcriptomic data with network and pathway analyses can reveal shared molecular mechanisms between seemingly distinct diseases. By identifying common gene signatures and leveraging drug repositioning strategies, the study opens a new avenue for developing therapies that target the intersection of inflammation and metabolism in RA-associated T2DM.

Merck is seeking regulatory approval for two new combination regimens using its drug Welireg to treat kidney cancer, even though it doesn't yet have data confirming it extends patients' lives. On Saturday, the company shared results from clinical trials combining Welireg with Keytruda and Lenvima, though specific efficacy data wasn't provided in the report. The move represents a strategic push to expand Welireg's label beyond its current approved uses, potentially offering new treatment options for kidney cancer patients. However, the lack of confirmatory data raises questions about the regulatory pathway and timeline for these potential label expansions. The combinations would pair Welireg's HIF-2α inhibition with Keytruda's immune checkpoint blockade and Lenvima's kinase inhibition, representing a multi-modal approach to kidney cancer treatment.
