    <h3>Highlights</h3>
    <ul><li>Leaving academia for industry is framed in the Nature article as a common yet taboo decision, driven by systemic pressures that accumulate around funding insecurity, the burdens of the publication system, misaligned research impact, and poor work‑life balance. The piece, based on a qualitative interview from the “Off Limits: Academia’s Taboos” podcast, presents the personal narrative of Josh Balsters, a former post‑doc who now directs neuroscience at NielsenIQ. His story illustrates the core claim that normalising discussion and creating clearer pathways—particularly hybrid industry‑academia roles—can ease the transition for researchers.</li><li>Balsters describes feeling “stable in terms of my career” but watching “all these little things… funding, the publication system… added up.” He critiques the current publishing model: “you write… send to a journal… reviewers work for free… you pay to get it published … pay to get it back again.” This financial and time burden, combined with the emotional toll of seeing his work on autistic individuals “not of interest to them,” fuels the desire to leave. The contrast in work‑life rhythm is stark: industry cycles can be “very quick… six weeks,” whereas academic grant cycles stretch over “years.” Yet the move is not without guilt; he admits a “feeling of letting people down” and worries about “taking a space away from somebody else.”</li><li>To decide, Balsters performed a “career audit,” identifying which academic elements to keep and which to discard. He also notes a communication barrier: “I didn’t discuss it with peers still in academia… I was afraid of what they might say.” The article’s suggested solutions—more hybrid positions, speaking out at conferences, and normalising the conversation—directly address these barriers.</li></ul>

    <h3>Highlights</h3>
    <ul><li>Welcome to Colorful Biology, where we unpack the latest breakthroughs in computational and molecular life science. Today’s deep dive is on a new resource that promises to sharpen our view of how cancers evolve in a tissue‑specific manner. The work comes from a team publishing in Nature, and the centerpiece is the Mouse Cancer Cell line Atlas, or MCCA for short.</li><li>The core claim, as laid out in the Nature article, is that the MCCA is a rigorously curated collection of mouse cancer cell lines. It brings together standardized generation, extensive quality‑control, deep phenotypic and molecular profiling—including whole‑exome and low‑coverage whole‑genome sequencing—and long‑term archiving. All of this is publicly released through a dedicated mouse‑specific cBioPortal. In other words, the authors are offering a one‑stop shop for researchers who need reliable mouse cancer models and the data that accompany them.</li><li>The methods are described in six main steps, and each step is designed to keep the lines as clean and reproducible as possible.</li></ul>
