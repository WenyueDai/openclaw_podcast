The title suggests that the work explores how advances in molecular biology can redesign the genetic and protein frameworks that underpin crop traits, nutrient content, or alternative protein sources such as cultured meat. By “rewriting the code of life,” the author likely discusses strategies such as precision gene editing, synthetic biology circuits, or de‑novo protein design to improve yield, stress tolerance, or nutritional quality. The piece is positioned within the protein bucket, indicating a focus on the molecular building blocks rather than whole‑organism breeding. While the full text is not available, the publication date and journal context imply that the study aligns with recent global efforts to reduce the environmental footprint of food systems through biotechnological innovation.

**CEP290 is Associated With Chromatin Accessibility of Hepatitis B Virus cccDNA**
In this 1 April 2026 paper, Sadahiro Iwabuchi and colleagues examine the role of the cellular protein CEP290 in modulating the chromatin landscape of hepatitis B virus covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). cccDNA is the stable, episomal form of the viral genome that persists in infected liver cells and serves as a template for viral transcription. The authors report an association between CEP290 and the openness of chromatin surrounding cccDNA, a factor that can influence viral gene expression and replication. By placing the study in the protein bucket, the work likely employs biochemical assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation, or imaging techniques to map CEP290’s binding and its impact on nucleosome positioning. Understanding how host factors like CEP290 affect cccDNA accessibility could open new avenues for therapeutic interventions aimed at silencing the viral reservoir. The article appears in the same issue of the Journal of Molecular Biology that hosts several other protein‑focused studies.

**Oligomerization‑Dependent Regulation of LrhA Controls Bacterial Flagellar Biosynthesis**
Baichun Niu, Masahide Kikkawa, and Xuguang Jiang report on 1 April 2026 how the transcription factor LrhA governs the construction of bacterial flagella, the whip‑like appendages that enable motility. The title highlights that LrhA’s activity depends on oligomerization, the process by which individual protein subunits assemble into a larger complex. When LrhA forms such oligomers, it can either activate or repress genes required for flagellar assembly, thereby fine‑tuning the biosynthetic pathway. The study, published in the Journal of Molecular Biology, likely combines structural biology, mutagenesis, and gene‑expression analyses to demonstrate the mechanistic link between LrhA’s multimeric state and flagellar gene regulation. By situating the work in the protein bucket, the authors emphasize the molecular underpinnings of bacterial motility, a trait that influences colonization, pathogenicity, and environmental adaptation. The findings add depth to our understanding of how protein‑protein interactions translate into complex cellular behaviors.

**Crystal Structure of PH0140: Exogenous Amino Acids Induce Open Octameric Assembly Enables Promoter⁽ᵀᵀᵀᵀ⁾ Binding for Transcription Regulation**
Richard Mariadasse and co‑authors present a structural investigation of the protein PH0140, published on 1 April 2026 in the Journal of Molecular Biology. Using X‑ray crystallography, the team resolved an octameric (eight‑subunit) assembly that adopts an open conformation when external amino acids bind. This conformational shift creates a surface capable of recognizing a specific DNA element denoted as promoter⁽ᵀᵀᵀᵀ⁾, thereby influencing transcription. An octameric assembly is a higher‑order oligomer that can provide cooperative binding sites, while “exogenous amino acids” refer to amino acids supplied from outside the cell or experimental system. The study likely details how ligand‑induced structural changes translate into DNA‑binding specificity, offering insight into a novel regulatory mechanism. By placing the work in the protein bucket, the authors focus on the relationship between three‑dimensional protein architecture and gene‑expression control, a theme central to molecular biology. The collaborative author list underscores a multidisciplinary effort spanning structural biology, biochemistry, and genomics.

**The Anticancer Drug Mitoxantrone Triggers the Formation of Ribosome‑Enriched Stress Granules Independently of the Classical Translational Control Pathways**
Marta Leśniczak‑Staszak and a broad international team report on 1 April 2026 that the chemotherapeutic agent mitoxantrone can induce the assembly of stress granules rich in ribosomes. Stress granules are cytoplasmic aggregates of stalled translation complexes that form in response to cellular stress, traditionally regulated by pathways that modulate initiation of protein synthesis. The authors claim that mitoxantrone’s effect bypasses these classical translational control mechanisms, suggesting a direct or alternative signaling route that reorganizes ribosomal components into granules. By focusing on ribosome‑enriched granules, the study likely employs microscopy, ribosome profiling, and biochemical fractionation to characterize the composition and dynamics of these structures. The findings could have implications for understanding how anticancer drugs impact cellular stress responses, potentially influencing drug efficacy or toxicity. Published in the Journal of Molecular Biology’s protein bucket, the work emphasizes the interplay between small‑molecule therapeutics and the protein synthesis machinery, adding a new layer to the pharmacological landscape of mitoxantrone.
**Structural Basis for Non‑classical WIN Peptides Recognition by WDR5**
Published on 1 April 2026 in *Journal of Molecular Biology* (Vol. 438, Issue 7), this article is authored by Yang Yang, Yan Pan, Qingying Wang, Hao Li, Shuting Zhang, Xuefang Sun, Lingyun Xia, Li Xu and Xuemin Chen. The work focuses on how the protein scaffold WDR5 engages with WIN peptides that do not follow the classic binding motif. “WIN” refers to a short peptide sequence that normally docks into a conserved pocket on WDR5, a regulator of chromatin-modifying complexes. By labeling the peptides as “non‑classical,” the authors signal that these ligands deviate from the canonical sequence, prompting a need to understand alternative recognition strategies. The paper likely presents high‑resolution structural data—such as X‑ray crystallography or cryo‑EM—to map the interaction surface and to reveal how subtle changes in peptide composition alter binding geometry. These insights could inform the design of selective inhibitors that modulate WDR5‑dependent pathways in epigenetic regulation.

**Rising Star: Combining Bioinformatics and Experimental Biology to Decoding Non‑coding RNAs and RNA Modifications**
Appearing on 1 April 2026 in *Journal of Molecular Biology* (Vol. 438, Issue 7), this contribution is authored solely by Xiu‑Jie Wang. The title signals a multidisciplinary approach that merges computational analysis with laboratory validation to explore the vast landscape of non‑coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and their chemical modifications. ncRNAs are RNA molecules that do not code for proteins but perform regulatory functions, while RNA modifications—collectively called the epitranscriptome—fine‑tune those functions. By integrating bioinformatics pipelines, the author can predict novel ncRNA candidates and map modification sites across the transcriptome. Experimental biology then tests these predictions, perhaps through techniques such as RNA‑seq, mass spectrometry, or mutagenesis, to confirm functional relevance. The article underscores how the synergy between in‑silico prediction and wet‑lab verification accelerates the discovery of previously hidden regulatory layers, offering new avenues for understanding gene expression control and disease mechanisms.

**Rising Star: G Protein‑coupled Receptors (GPCRs) in Microenvironment Pharmacology and Sensory Perception Pharmacology**
This paper, dated 1 April 2026 in *Journal of Molecular Biology* (Vol. 438, Issue 7), lists Jia‑Le Wang, Shen‑Ming Huang, Nai‑Kang Rong, Shu‑Hua Zhou, Yi Sun and Jin‑Peng Sun as authors. It spotlights GPCRs—membrane proteins that translate extracellular signals into intracellular responses—within two emerging subfields. “Microenvironment pharmacology” examines how the local cellular milieu, including extracellular matrix components and neighboring cells, influences drug action on GPCRs. “Sensory perception pharmacology” focuses on GPCRs that mediate senses such as taste, smell, and vision, and how pharmacological agents can modulate these pathways. By framing the work as a “Rising Star” piece, the authors likely review recent advances, highlight novel ligands, and discuss experimental models that capture the complexity of the microenvironment or sensory systems. The article may also address challenges in targeting GPCRs with high specificity while accounting for tissue‑specific contexts, thereby guiding future therapeutic strategies that respect the nuanced biology of these receptors.

**Rising Stars: Molecular Mechanisms of Ligand Recognition and Functional Modulation of GPCRs**
Published 1 April 2026 in *Journal of Molecular Biology* (Vol. 438, Issue 7), this contribution is authored by Shuo Han, Qiuxiang Tan, Shuling Lin, Kun Chen, Maozhou He, Qiang Zhao and Beili Wu. The title indicates a deep dive into how GPCRs bind their ligands—molecules such as hormones, neurotransmitters, or drugs—and how that binding translates into functional outcomes. “Ligand recognition” refers to the precise molecular contacts that allow a GPCR to discriminate among many potential partners, often involving conserved transmembrane pockets and extracellular loops. “Functional modulation” describes the subsequent conformational changes that either activate or inhibit downstream signaling pathways. The authors likely synthesize structural, biophysical, and cellular data to map these processes, perhaps highlighting allosteric sites that offer alternative routes for drug design. By labeling the work as a “Rising Stars” article, the paper probably emphasizes cutting‑edge discoveries and emerging concepts that could reshape how researchers approach GPCR‑targeted therapeutics, especially in the context of biased signaling and receptor dynamics.

**Rising Star: Exploring Weak Biomolecular Interactions: My Steady and Evolving Journey**
This piece, also dated 1 April 2026 in *Journal of Molecular Biology* (Vol. 438, Issue 7), is authored by Pilong Li. The title suggests a personal narrative combined with scientific insight into weak biomolecular interactions—transient, low‑affinity contacts such as hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, or electrostatic attractions that nonetheless play crucial roles in cellular processes like signaling, assembly of macromolecular complexes, and enzyme catalysis. Because these interactions are fleeting, they are challenging to detect and quantify, often requiring specialized techniques like isothermal titration calorimetry, surface plasmon resonance, or NMR relaxation methods. The author’s “steady and evolving journey” likely chronicles methodological advances, lessons learned, and key case studies where weak interactions have been pivotal. By framing the article as a “Rising Star,” the journal highlights the author’s growing expertise and contributions to a field that underpins many aspects of molecular biology, encouraging readers to appreciate the subtle forces that shape biological function.
Rising Stars: In vivo Monitoring of Neurochemical Dynamics by Genetically Encoded Neuromodulator Sensors
This article, authored by Shengwei Fu and Yulong Li, appears in the Journal of Molecular Biology, Volume 438, Issue 7, with a publication date of 1 April 2026. The work focuses on tools that allow scientists to track neurochemical changes directly inside living organisms—a practice described by the term “in vivo,” meaning within the intact biological system rather than in isolated cells or test tubes. The authors highlight genetically encoded neuromodulator sensors, which are protein constructs introduced into the genome to fluoresce or otherwise signal the presence of specific neurotransmitters. By coupling sensor expression to native cellular machinery, these probes can report real‑time fluctuations in dopamine, serotonin, or other modulators as they occur during behavior or disease processes. The paper positions these sensors as a “rising star” technology, suggesting they could transform our understanding of brain signaling dynamics, enable high‑resolution mapping of neural circuits, and accelerate drug discovery aimed at neuromodulatory pathways.

Deciphering Plant‑Microbe Symbioses: A Molecular Blueprint for Precision Agriculture
Ertao Wang’s contribution, also published in the Journal of Molecular Biology (Volume 438, Issue 7, 1 April 2026), tackles the intricate partnerships between plants and the microbes that colonize their roots, leaves, or internal tissues. The title promises a “molecular blueprint,” indicating that the study maps the genetic and biochemical interactions that underpin these symbioses. By elucidating signaling molecules, receptor proteins, and metabolic exchanges, the work aims to provide a foundation for precision agriculture—an approach that tailors inputs such as fertilizers, water, or microbial inoculants to the specific needs of a crop based on its molecular profile. The article suggests that a deeper mechanistic understanding could enable farmers to harness beneficial microbes for improved nutrient uptake, stress resilience, and yield, while reducing reliance on broad‑spectrum chemicals. Wang’s research therefore positions plant‑microbe cooperation as a key lever for sustainable, data‑driven farming practices.

Rising Stars: Adaptation to Environment: From Hormone Signaling to Gene Silencing
In this collaborative paper by Hongwei Guo, Yichuan Wang, Zhenyu Wang, and Yuelin Liu, the Journal of Molecular Biology (Volume 438, Issue 7, 1 April 2026) explores how organisms adjust to environmental challenges through two major regulatory layers. Hormone signaling refers to the cascade of molecular events triggered by plant or animal hormones that alter cellular activity, while gene silencing describes mechanisms—such as RNA interference—that suppress the expression of specific genes. By linking these processes, the authors illustrate a continuum from rapid, hormone‑driven responses to longer‑term, epigenetic adjustments that lock down or activate genetic programs. The article likely surveys recent discoveries that reveal cross‑talk between hormone receptors and silencing complexes, offering insight into how organisms fine‑tune growth, development, and stress responses. This synthesis positions the combined pathways as a “rising star” area of research, with implications for crop improvement, disease resistance, and understanding adaptive evolution.

Rising Star: Single Cell Omics Technologies: When Whole Omics Analysis Meets Single Cell Resolution
Fuchou Tang’s contribution, featured in the Journal of Molecular Biology (Volume 438, Issue 7, 1 April 2026), spotlights the convergence of comprehensive omics profiling—such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics—with the precision of single‑cell analysis. Traditional “whole omics” approaches average signals across millions of cells, potentially masking rare or transient states. Single‑cell omics resolves this limitation by measuring molecular content in individual cells, revealing heterogeneity within tissues, tumors, or developmental stages. The paper likely reviews recent platforms that integrate high‑throughput sequencing, mass spectrometry, and microfluidic isolation to capture multiple molecular layers from the same cell. By doing so, researchers can reconstruct cell‑type specific pathways, trace lineage trajectories, and identify novel subpopulations that drive disease or regeneration. Tang frames these advances as a “rising star,” emphasizing their transformative potential for precision medicine, developmental biology, and systems-level understanding of complex biological systems.

The Structure of the Full Catalytic Cycle of Vibrio cholerae NFeoB
Published online on 20 February 2026 in the Journal of Molecular Biology, this study is authored by Kate Magante, Candice M. Armstrong, Mark Lee, and Aaron T. Smith. It presents the three‑dimensional structure of NFeoB, a membrane‑associated GTP‑binding protein from the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, captured at multiple stages of its catalytic cycle. The term “catalytic cycle” refers to the sequence of conformational changes a protein undergoes as it binds and hydrolyzes GTP, converting chemical energy into mechanical work. By visualizing the full cycle, the authors provide insight into how NFeoB coordinates iron transport across the bacterial membrane—a process essential for pathogen survival and virulence. The structural snapshots likely reveal nucleotide‑bound, transition, and product‑release states, clarifying the molecular basis of GTP hydrolysis and its coupling to iron uptake. This comprehensive view positions NFeoB as a potential target for antimicrobial strategies aimed at disrupting iron acquisition in cholera‑causing bacteria.
**Item 1 – Structural, mechanistic and phylogenetic insights into a freshwater actinorhodopsin**
The paper, published online on 18 February 2026 in the *Journal of Molecular Biology*, brings together Nadia Djabeur, Jean‑Marc Jeckelmann, Nooraldeen Ayoub, Daniel Harder and Dimitrios Fotiadis to dissect a newly identified actinorhodopsin from a freshwater environment. Actinorhodopsins are a subclass of microbial rhodopsins that function as light‑driven ion pumps, typically moving protons across membranes. The authors combine high‑resolution structural data with mechanistic assays to map how the protein captures photons and converts that energy into ion transport. In parallel, they perform a phylogenetic analysis that positions this freshwater variant among known rhodopsin families, highlighting evolutionary divergences that may reflect adaptation to low‑salinity habitats. By integrating three complementary perspectives—structure, function and evolutionary history—the study deepens our understanding of how light‑responsive proteins diversify across ecological niches, and it sets the stage for future engineering of optogenetic tools derived from non‑marine sources.

**Item 2 – Importance of riboswitch‑regulated genes for *Pseudomonas aeruginosa***
Available online from 18 February 2026, this contribution by Shirin Jahangirnejad, Jean‑Philippe Côté and Daniel A. Lafontaine examines how riboswitches shape the gene expression landscape of the opportunistic pathogen *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*. A riboswitch is an RNA element that binds a small metabolite and, upon binding, alters the conformation of the messenger RNA to turn downstream genes on or off. The authors catalog riboswitch‑controlled genes in *P. aeruginosa* and assess their roles in processes such as virulence, metabolism and antibiotic resistance. By linking specific riboswitches to phenotypic outcomes, the work underscores the regulatory importance of these RNA sensors in bacterial adaptability. The study also hints at potential therapeutic angles: targeting riboswitches could disrupt essential pathways without affecting human cells, offering a novel avenue for antimicrobial development.

**Item 3 – Rising Stars: Molecular and functional diversity of the sensory nervous system**
Published on 16 February 2026, Xinbo Ni and Wenwen Zeng present a concise overview of emerging research on the sensory nervous system’s molecular and functional heterogeneity. The article surveys recent discoveries that reveal how distinct sensory neuron subtypes express unique repertoires of receptors, ion channels and signaling molecules, enabling the detection of a broad spectrum of stimuli—from mechanical pressure to chemical cues. By highlighting “rising stars” in the field, the authors draw attention to novel genetic markers and functional assays that are reshaping our understanding of sensory coding. The piece also discusses how this diversity underpins specialized behaviors and how dysregulation can lead to sensory disorders. Although brief, the review serves as a roadmap for researchers seeking to explore under‑characterized sensory pathways and to develop targeted interventions for conditions such as chronic pain or anosmia.

**Item 4 – Cell Lines CoCoPUTs: A Database of Codon and Codon‑pair Usage Frequencies in Cell Lines**
On 16 February 2026, a multidisciplinary team led by Nigam Padhiar and colleagues released CoCoPUTs, a curated database that quantifies how individual codons and adjacent codon‑pairs are employed across a wide array of cultured cell lines. Codon usage refers to the preference for certain three‑nucleotide sequences that encode the same amino acid, while codon‑pair usage captures the frequency with which specific codon pairs appear together in coding sequences. These biases influence translation efficiency, protein folding and heterologous gene expression. The CoCoPUTs resource aggregates sequencing data from dozens of human and animal cell lines, providing researchers with searchable tables and visualizations. By making these metrics readily accessible, the database aids synthetic biologists in optimizing gene constructs for specific cellular contexts, potentially improving yields of recombinant proteins or the performance of gene‑therapy vectors. The authors also discuss how codon‑pair patterns may reflect cellular tRNA pools and metabolic states.

**Item 5 – PERCEPTRON‑PTMKB: A Web Server for Residue‑Based Post‑Translational Modification Analysis and Propensity Scoring**
The *Journal of Molecular Biology* made this work available on 12 February 2026. Abdullah Bin Faiz, Muhammad Shoaib and Safee Ullah Chaudary introduce PERCEPTRON‑PTMKB, an online platform that evaluates the likelihood of specific amino‑acid residues undergoing post‑translational modifications (PTMs). PTMs are chemical alterations—such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination or methylation—that occur after a protein is synthesized and can dramatically alter its activity, stability or interactions. The server accepts protein sequences, predicts potential modification sites, and assigns a propensity score that reflects how favorable each site is based on sequence context, structural features and known PTM motifs. By integrating multiple predictive algorithms, PERCEPTRON‑PTMKB offers a unified view for researchers designing mutagenesis experiments or interpreting mass‑spectrometry data. The authors demonstrate the tool’s utility across several model proteins, showing improved accuracy over existing single‑method predictors. This resource promises to streamline PTM annotation in proteomics pipelines and to aid hypothesis generation in functional studies.
**Nucleotide‑Resolution Mapping Reveals Specific Helicase Binding Site on roX2 lncRNA**
The Journal of Molecular Biology published this study online on 11 February 2026. Led by Susmit Narayan Chaudhury, Nathan Edward Jespersen and Karissa Y. Sanbonmatsu, the authors applied nucleotide‑resolution mapping techniques to locate where a helicase protein interacts with the roX2 long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA). An lncRNA is an RNA molecule longer than 200 nucleotides that does not code for protein but can regulate gene expression. By pinpointing the exact nucleotides bound by the helicase, the work clarifies how roX2 may influence chromatin structure or transcriptional control. The precise mapping also provides a template for studying other RNA‑protein interfaces, potentially informing therapeutic strategies that target RNA‑binding proteins. Although the full text is not yet available, the title and author list suggest a detailed structural and functional analysis of this specific RNA‑protein interaction.

**SFPQ Promotes Homologous Recombination via mRNA Stabilization of RAD51 and Its Paralogs**
Available online on 10 February 2026 in the Journal of Molecular Biology, this paper lists Sofia Gotthold, Keile R. Hansen, Andrew N. Brown and a broad collaborative team as authors. The research focuses on the protein SFPQ and its role in homologous recombination, a DNA repair pathway that uses an undamaged sister chromatid as a template to accurately fix double‑strand breaks. The authors report that SFPQ enhances this process by stabilizing the messenger RNAs of RAD51 and related paralogous genes, preventing their degradation and ensuring sufficient protein production. mRNA stabilization refers to mechanisms that extend the lifespan of messenger RNA molecules, thereby increasing translation efficiency. By linking SFPQ activity to the expression of key recombination factors, the study highlights a regulatory layer that could be exploited to improve genome stability or sensitize cancer cells to DNA‑damaging therapies.

**CLISGen: A Comprehensive Resource of SNP Genotypes for Human Cell Lines**
Published online on 6 February 2026, this contribution to the Journal of Molecular Biology is authored by Matteo Marchesin, Davide Dalfovo and Alessandro Romanel. CLISGen is presented as a database compiling single‑nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes across a wide panel of human cell lines. An SNP represents a single base‑pair variation in the genome that can affect gene function or drug response. By aggregating these genotype data, CLISGen offers researchers a ready reference for selecting cell lines that match specific genetic backgrounds, facilitating reproducibility and precision in functional genomics, pharmacogenomics, and disease modeling. The resource promises to streamline experimental design and enable more accurate interpretation of genotype‑phenotype relationships, though the full methodological details await the complete article.

**mCSM‑metal: A Deep Learning Resource to Predict Effect of Mutations on Metal Ion Binding**
The Journal of Molecular Biology released this article online on 5 February 2026. Akshita Kumar, Ashar J. Malik and David B. Ascher are credited as the developers of mCSM‑metal, a computational tool that employs deep learning—a form of artificial intelligence that uses layered neural networks—to forecast how amino‑acid substitutions influence a protein’s ability to bind metal ions. Metal ion binding is crucial for catalytic activity, structural stability, and regulatory functions in many enzymes. By training the model on known mutation‑binding outcomes, mCSM‑metal can rapidly assess the potential impact of novel variants, aiding in the interpretation of genetic data and the design of engineered proteins. The tool’s predictive capacity could accelerate research in metalloprotein biology and support clinical assessments of mutation pathogenicity.

**ABSEIL: A Polypeptide Helicity and Ensemble Prediction Tool**
Also published on 5 February 2026 in the Journal of Molecular Biology, this work lists Hannah Hortman, Ruiling A. Zhang, Roy G. Hughes Jr. and a multidisciplinary team of co‑authors. ABSEIL is introduced as a software platform that predicts the helicity—i.e., the propensity of a peptide segment to form an α‑helix—and the conformational ensemble of polypeptides. Helicity influences protein folding, stability, and interaction interfaces, while an ensemble describes the range of structures a flexible peptide may adopt in solution. By integrating sequence information with statistical or machine‑learning models, ABSEIL aims to provide researchers with rapid, accurate estimates of secondary‑structure tendencies without requiring costly experimental measurements. Such predictions can guide peptide design for therapeutics, biomaterials, or synthetic biology applications, offering a valuable complement to experimental structural biology.
