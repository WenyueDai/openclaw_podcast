Robert Bullard, often called the father of environmental justice, argues that researchers in the field have more reason than ever to back up their work with action. His decades of work show that data alone is not enough to drive transformative change. Bullard's approach integrates scientific research with community-driven activism, treating the environment as all the places where people live, work, learn, play, and worship.

In the late 1970s, Bullard documented that solid-waste landfill sites in Houston, Texas, were disproportionately located in predominantly Black neighborhoods. This research, which he conducted with his wife, an attorney, became the foundation for a lawsuit that successfully challenged the discriminatory siting of these facilities. The case demonstrated that rigorous data, when paired with legal and policy advocacy, could achieve real-world impact.

Bullard's 1990 book *Dumping in Dixie* chronicled actions by five predominantly Black communities in the southern US to combat deadly pollution. The book became a standard textbook and helped establish environmental justice as a field of study. The foundational research and theoretical framework for the movement came from five HBCU-based centers, including the Environmental Justice Resource Center at Clark Atlanta University, which Bullard founded.

Bullard emphasizes that community-based participatory research, driven from the "bottom up" by communities partnering with academic researchers, is essential. This approach ensures that research questions are defined by those most affected and that findings are packaged in ways that resonate with policymakers. He argues that researchers must move beyond publishing papers to engaging in lawsuits, policy advocacy, and other forms of activism to achieve environmental justice.

The White House is blocking the release of Congressionally-approved 2026 funding to major US science agencies, creating a bottleneck that could slow or halt new research grants. This is not a budget cut—Congress rejected sweeping reductions—but a delay in execution that effectively freezes spending.

The Office of Management and Budget has revised Circular A-11, the federal budget manual, to restrict automatic 30-day funding increments to "essential expenses" like salaries. For NASA, OMB went further, using a footnote in a budgetary notice to explicitly withhold spending authority for ten specific programs until additional justification is provided.

The National Institutes of Health has received zero approval to spend its 2026 appropriations. It can only issue new grants using carryover funds from previous years. The National Science Foundation and NASA face similar restrictions, though the exact scope varies by agency.

This represents a significant shift in the traditional budget execution process. Normally, once Congress approves a budget, agencies can begin spending according to established timelines. Now, OMB is inserting itself as a gatekeeper, requiring additional review before funds can flow.

The practical impact is immediate: research institutions may see hiring freezes, delayed equipment purchases, and uncertainty about future grant cycles. Scientists awaiting funding decisions are left in limbo, unable to plan multi-year projects with confidence.

The available text does not specify how long these restrictions will last or what criteria OMB will use to release funds. It also does not detail which specific NASA programs are affected beyond the footnote reference. What is clear is that this administrative hold-up, rather than a legislative cut, is the mechanism creating the bottleneck.

Nature's editors have issued an expression of concern for a 2003 paper titled "The gene product Murr1 restricts HIV-1 replication in resting CD4+ lymphocytes." The concern centers on duplicated control panels in Figure 3b of the original article. Specifically, the editors note that separate panels in Figures 3c and 3d independently confirm specificity with respect to two reference genes, Skp1 and Actin. However, the raw data for the original study is no longer available, preventing independent verification of the findings.

This expression of concern highlights a critical issue in scientific publishing: data integrity and transparency. The duplication of control panels in a key figure raises questions about the reliability of the presented evidence for the activity of the Murr1 siRNA and the specificity of the knockdown effect. Without access to the raw data, it's impossible to assess the full impact of these duplicated elements or verify the original results.

The notice doesn't conclude that the study's conclusions are invalid, but it does create uncertainty about the robustness of that specific evidence. This situation underscores the importance of data preservation and the challenges faced when raw data becomes unavailable over time. It also serves as a reminder of the ongoing need for rigorous peer review and post-publication scrutiny in scientific research.

For listeners unfamiliar with some of the terms, an expression of concern is a formal notice from a journal's editors alerting readers to a potential problem with a published article. Murr1 is the gene/protein studied in the original research, while HIV-1 is the virus that causes AIDS. Resting CD4+ lymphocytes are a type of immune cell that HIV infects, and "resting" means they are not actively dividing. siRNA, or small interfering RNA, is a tool used in labs to silence or reduce the expression of a specific gene. Knockdown refers to the reduction of a gene's expression, often achieved using siRNA. Control panels are parts of a scientific figure showing baseline or comparison data to validate an experimental result, and reference genes like Skp1 and Actin are used as a baseline to normalize and compare other gene expression measurements.

Pokémon turns 30 this year, and Nature is taking a look at how this Japanese media phenomenon has shaped scientific research in surprising ways. The article draws on interviews with multiple scientists who grew up as Pokémon fans, finding that the game's core mechanics of collecting, classifying, and evolving creatures mirror fundamental aspects of biological research.

Several scientists describe how Pokémon's creature collection system parallels their professional work in taxonomy and biodiversity. One researcher notes that the process of catching and cataloging Pokémon is essentially identical to what entomologists do when collecting and classifying insects. This connection runs deep enough that researchers have named real species after Pokémon characters - for example, the bee *Chilicola charizard* bears the name of the iconic fire-breathing creature.

The influence extends beyond individual inspiration. A 2002 UK survey found that children could name more Pokémon than local wildlife species, suggesting the game had already created a framework for understanding biological diversity. This insight led to the development of the "Phylo" card game, a Pokémon-inspired educational tool that teaches players about ecosystems, food chains, and environmental threats through gameplay mechanics similar to the original.

Museums have also embraced the connection. The Field Museum created an exhibition explicitly linking Pokémon designs to real fossil taxa - showing how Aerodactyl resembles pterosaurs, or how Archeops mirrors the ancient bird *Archaeopteryx*. These exhibitions use Pokémon's familiar visual language to introduce visitors to actual evolutionary concepts and paleontological discoveries.

The article presents this as a case study in how pop culture can serve as an unexpected scaffold for scientific engagement. By providing a shared vocabulary and conceptual framework, Pokémon has created pathways for public understanding of complex biological concepts, from evolution to ecosystem dynamics. While the evidence is largely anecdotal, coming from scientists who were already Pokémon fans, it demonstrates how childhood interests can translate into sustained scientific literacy and even career paths in research.

A seven-generation Utah family has produced the first clear evidence in humans of a potential Y-chromosome "sex distorter" gene—a type of "selfish gene" that biases its own transmission by producing more male offspring. Researchers analyzing anonymized genealogical data from the Utah Population Database identified one family with a sustained, statistically significant male-biased sex ratio of 60 males to 29 females across seven documented generations.

The study focused on paternal lineages because Y-chromosome-based sex distorters are theoretically easier to detect in genealogical records than X-chromosome distorters. The researchers applied two unspecified statistical tests to the recorded sexes of 76,445 individuals across more than 26,000 paternal lineages to identify families with a male bias unlikely to occur by chance.

This finding is significant because sex distorters have been documented in various animals—from fruit flies to mice—but never conclusively in humans. The concept of "selfish genes" refers to genetic elements that enhance their own transmission at the expense of other genes or the organism's overall fitness. In this case, a Y-chromosome distorter would increase its frequency by producing more male offspring who carry the same Y chromosome.

However, not all researchers are convinced. The available text does not provide details on the specific statistical methods used or the exact p-values that established significance. Some scientists may question whether the observed bias could result from cultural factors, reporting biases in historical records, or other confounding variables not accounted for in the analysis.

The researchers note that if confirmed, this would represent the first documented case of a sex distorter in humans, potentially opening new avenues for understanding human sex ratio variation and the evolutionary dynamics of selfish genetic elements in our species.

When historians look at the human hand, they're not just seeing fingers and palms—they're seeing centuries of attempts to decode the body's "mysterious, curious, and often complex codes." That's the central thread in Alison Bashford's historical exploration of how physicians, scientists, and anthropologists have interpreted hand features, from creases to fingerprints, as windows into genetics, character, and health.

The most striking example she highlights comes from geneticist Lionel Penrose, who in 1973 published correlations between genetic abnormalities and specific hand crease patterns in *The Lancet* under the title "Fingerprints and palmistry." What makes this fascinating is how it sits at the intersection of legitimate science and the long shadow of palmistry—the practice of reading palms to predict fate or character. Penrose's work represents an attempt to ground what was once purely mystical in observable biological patterns, yet it also reveals how easily scientific inquiry can drift into territory that looks suspiciously like pseudoscience.

This history matters because it shows how physical features have been used—sometimes responsibly, sometimes not—to make claims about internal states. The hand becomes a text to be read, with each line potentially revealing something about a person's genetic makeup or even their destiny. It's a reminder that the tools of science have often been applied to questions that blend the empirical with the deeply human desire to find meaning in physical form.

The review doesn't specify the full chronological scope of Bashford's work or detail other key figures beyond Penrose, but the implication is clear: this is a story that stretches from ancient divination practices through the development of modern genetics, showing how our understanding of the body has always been entangled with our cultural beliefs about what makes us who we are.

Shifting from the intimate scale of the human hand to the planetary scale of climate change, Wim Carton and Andreas Malm present a sobering assessment of our current trajectory. Their core argument is stark: given that mitigation efforts have failed to meet climate targets, the world must urgently focus on three remaining options—adaptation, carbon dioxide removal, and solar geoengineering.

The evidence they marshal is brutally concrete. In 2023, the United States "pumped more oil and gas than any country had ever done in history." This single statistic encapsulates the continued dominance of fossil fuels despite decades of climate agreements and warnings. It's not just that we're failing to reduce emissions; we're accelerating in the wrong direction.

This matters because it forces a confrontation with reality. If we're going to overshoot temperature goals—which current data suggests is increasingly likely—then the conversation needs to shift from prevention to response. The three options they outline represent fundamentally different approaches: adaptation means learning to live with the changes; carbon dioxide removal attempts to undo some of the damage; and solar geoengineering would involve deliberately intervening in Earth's climate system to block sunlight.

The review doesn't detail specific critiques of these options or how the authors define "mitigation failure," but the framework itself is provocative. It suggests that the climate debate needs to move beyond the binary of "act now or face catastrophe" to a more nuanced discussion of what emergency responses might actually look like when prevention has failed.

Finally, archaeologist Eric H. Cline turns to the Amarna letters—clay tablets inscribed with cuneiform script from ancient Egypt—as a window into Bronze Age diplomacy. These tablets, discovered in the ruins of Pharaoh Akhenaten's capital, represent one of the earliest extensive collections of diplomatic correspondence, offering unprecedented insight into how ancient Near Eastern powers negotiated, formed alliances, and managed conflicts.

The letters reveal a complex web of relationships between Egypt, Babylon, Assyria, Hatti, and various Canaanite city-states. They show rulers addressing each other as "brothers," exchanging lavish gifts, and complaining about the quality of the gold they received. But they also reveal the fragility of these relationships—requests for military aid, accusations of treaty violations, and desperate pleas for support against invading forces.

What makes this particularly significant is that these aren't just administrative records or royal propaganda. They're personal communications between rulers, complete with the tensions, negotiations, and occasional pettiness that characterize international relations in any era. A Babylonian king might complain that the Egyptian gold is inferior to what he sends, while a Canaanite ruler begs for archers to defend against invaders.

The Amarna letters matter because they provide concrete evidence for how international systems functioned in the ancient world, challenging our assumptions about the sophistication of Bronze Age diplomacy. They show that the basic dynamics of international relations—alliance-building, resource exchange, military cooperation, and diplomatic friction—have remained remarkably consistent across millennia.

The review doesn't specify Cline's particular arguments about what these letters reveal about the collapse of Bronze Age civilizations, but the implication is that they offer crucial evidence for understanding both the interconnectedness and the vulnerabilities of ancient political systems. In an era where we're grappling with our own global interconnectedness and its potential fragilities, these ancient diplomatic exchanges take on new relevance.

This study tackles a pressing challenge in the ongoing fight against COVID-19: the rapid emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with spike protein mutations that can undermine vaccine effectiveness. The researchers took a computational approach to design two multi-epitope vaccine constructs, named Cov19-B and Cov19-T, targeting both conserved regions and mutation-derived epitopes from the spike proteins of the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Omicron variants.

The core idea was to identify epitopes—short amino acid sequences that can trigger immune responses—that are either conserved across variants or derived from notable mutations. By combining these into a single vaccine construct, the goal was to elicit broad humoral (antibody-mediated) and cellular immunity, potentially offering protection against a wider range of SARS-CoV-2 strains than current vaccines.

The two constructs differ in size: Cov19-B is 649 amino acids long and weighs about 74 kilodaltons, while Cov19-T is slightly smaller at 465 amino acids. Both were designed using immunoinformatics tools, which involve computational prediction of how well candidate epitopes will bind to human immune molecules (like MHC class I and II) and stimulate T-cell and B-cell responses.

The novelty here lies in the focus on both conserved and variant-specific epitopes, aiming to cover the antigenic diversity seen in circulating strains. This approach could help address the problem of immune escape, where mutations allow the virus to evade antibodies generated by earlier infection or vaccination.

However, the available text does not provide details on the specific epitopes selected, the exact computational methods used, or experimental validation results. It also doesn't mention whether these constructs have been tested in vitro or in animal models, or how they compare to existing vaccines in terms of predicted efficacy or safety.

In summary, this work represents a promising computational strategy to broaden COVID-19 vaccine coverage by targeting both stable and evolving parts of the spike protein. While the approach is innovative, experimental validation will be essential to determine if these multi-epitope constructs can deliver the broad and lasting immunity they aim to provide.

The COVID-19 pandemic triggered an unprecedented surge in antiviral drug development, with researchers targeting both SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human host factors to control viral infection. This massive effort involved thousands of patients in clinical trials and produced numerous potential drug candidates.

The review examines the current state of antiviral drug discovery, highlighting both successes and persistent challenges. One key insight is that while the pandemic accelerated development timelines, it also exposed fundamental limitations in our approach to antiviral therapeutics.

A major challenge identified is the high mutation rate of RNA viruses like SARS-CoV-2. This creates a moving target for drug development, as viral variants can quickly emerge with resistance to existing treatments. The review notes that drugs targeting highly conserved viral proteins or essential host factors may offer more durable solutions, but these approaches come with their own complications.

Host-directed therapies, which target human proteins that viruses hijack for replication, represent an intriguing strategy. These drugs could potentially work against multiple viral families since many pathogens use similar host pathways. However, the review points out that interfering with essential human proteins carries risks of toxicity and side effects that must be carefully managed.

The development pipeline faces additional hurdles including lengthy clinical trial timelines, high costs, and the challenge of predicting which drug candidates will succeed in humans. The review emphasizes that many promising preclinical candidates fail during human testing due to issues with bioavailability, safety, or efficacy.

Looking forward, the authors identify several promising directions. These include developing broad-spectrum antivirals that work against multiple viruses, improving our understanding of viral-host interactions to identify new drug targets, and leveraging artificial intelligence to accelerate drug discovery. The review also stresses the importance of maintaining pandemic preparedness infrastructure even as COVID-19 transitions to endemic status.

The available text does not provide specific data on success rates, timelines, or detailed mechanisms of particular drug candidates, focusing instead on the broader landscape and strategic considerations for future antiviral development.

Cryptosporidium hominis and Cryptosporidium parvum are two of the most common species causing cryptosporidiosis, a diarrheal disease that affects both humans and animals. There is currently no FDA-approved vaccine for this infection, which is why researchers turned to mRNA vaccine technology to develop a new candidate.

The team used a reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics approach to identify potential vaccine targets. They started by screening the genomes of both Cryptosporidium species to find proteins that are likely to be exposed on the parasite's surface or secreted during infection. These proteins are ideal vaccine targets because they are more likely to be recognized by the immune system.

From this screening, they selected a set of antigens that showed promise for inducing a strong immune response. These antigens were then incorporated into an mRNA vaccine design. The mRNA encodes the selected antigens, which, once delivered into host cells, are translated into proteins that can trigger both antibody and T-cell responses.

The vaccine was tested in preclinical models, where it demonstrated the ability to generate immune responses against both C. hominis and C. parvum. This dual protection is important because both species can infect humans, and exposure to one does not necessarily confer immunity to the other.

The use of mRNA technology here is significant because it allows for rapid development and easy modification of the vaccine if needed. It also avoids the need for live pathogens, making it safer to produce and handle.

This work represents a promising step toward a vaccine for cryptosporidiosis, a disease that disproportionately affects young children, immunocompromised individuals, and livestock. While further testing is needed before it can be used in humans or animals, the approach shows how modern computational and molecular tools can be combined to tackle diseases that have long resisted traditional vaccine development.

Liver fibrosis is a major cause of chronic liver disease, and while chimeric antigen receptor macrophages—CAR-Ms—have shown promise in targeting fibrotic tissue, their effectiveness has been limited by insufficient anti-inflammatory capacity once they reach the fibrotic site. To address this, researchers engineered a new approach that boosts the anti-inflammatory phenotype of CAR-Ms directly inside the body.

The key innovation is a ROS-responsive lipid nanoparticle called ESLNP, which carries mRNA encoding both a chimeric antigen receptor and the protein TRIM13. This nanoparticle is designed to be taken up specifically by fibrosis-associated macrophages. Once inside, the mRNA is translated, and TRIM13 reprograms the macrophages to adopt a stronger anti-inflammatory state. At the same time, the CAR component equips these cells to recognize and eliminate activated hepatic stellate cells—the main drivers of fibrosis.

The system is triggered by the high levels of reactive oxygen species found in fibrotic tissue, ensuring that the mRNA is released and expressed only where it's needed. This in situ engineering means the macrophages are reprogrammed on-site rather than being modified outside the body and reinfused, which could improve targeting and reduce off-target effects.

In mouse models of liver fibrosis, this approach led to a significant reduction in fibrotic markers and improved liver function, demonstrating that boosting the anti-inflammatory capacity of CAR-Ms can enhance their therapeutic effect. The method represents a step forward in cell-based therapies for fibrosis by combining targeted delivery, local reprogramming, and specific cell killing in a single system.

PON-Del is a new computational tool designed to predict the pathogenicity of short protein deletions—specifically those that remove between one and ten amino acids while keeping the rest of the protein sequence intact. These deletions are common in both disease-causing and benign genetic variants, but many are misclassified in clinical and research databases, especially when the mRNA transcript is degraded by cellular quality-control mechanisms.

The tool was developed by curating a dataset of 4,243 short in-frame deletions from sources like ClinVar, LOVD, dbSNP, and UniProtKB, all mapped to MANE-selected transcripts for consistency. From this data, 611 features were extracted across four categories: context-based features capturing sequence conservation around the deletion site, content-based features describing the local amino acid composition, structural features reflecting the deletion's impact on protein folding, and functional features assessing the role of the deleted region.

PON-Del's performance was evaluated using multiple metrics, including area under the ROC curve, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Matthews correlation coefficient. It outperformed existing tools such as MutPred-Indel, PROVEAN, and SIFT Indel in predicting whether a deletion is pathogenic or benign. Notably, PON-Del also provides a three-state classification—pathogenic, benign, or variant of uncertain significance (VUS)—which is particularly useful for clinical decision-making where uncertainty is common.

The tool is accessible via a web service at http://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/pondel/, allowing researchers and clinicians to submit deletion sequences and receive predictions along with confidence scores. PON-Del's ability to handle both binary and three-state classifications, combined with its superior predictive accuracy, makes it a valuable resource for interpreting short protein deletions in genetic studies and clinical diagnostics. The available text does not provide details on the specific machine learning algorithms or training procedures used to build the model.

Protein structure prediction has made incredible strides in recent years, with tools like AlphaFold achieving near-atomic accuracy from sequence alone. But structure is only part of the story. Proteins are not static molecules—they flex, shift, and undergo conformational changes that are essential for their biological function. Predicting these dynamics from sequence remains a major unsolved challenge.

To bridge this gap, researchers are calling for a much larger experimental database linking protein sequence, dynamics, and function. One promising approach to building this database is high-pressure nuclear magnetic resonance, or HP-NMR. This technique applies pressures up to several kilobars to protein samples while monitoring their behavior using NMR spectroscopy.

The key insight is that pressure perturbs the equilibrium between different conformational states of a protein. By systematically varying pressure and measuring the resulting changes in NMR signals, scientists can map out the energy landscape of protein dynamics with remarkable detail. This includes detecting rare, functionally important states that might be invisible under ambient conditions.

HP-NMR has already revealed new details about how proteins fold, bind ligands, and undergo allosteric regulation. For example, pressure can shift the balance between folded and partially unfolded states, exposing transient intermediates that play critical roles in function. It can also probe the compressibility and flexibility of specific regions within a protein, offering clues about which parts are most dynamic.

The technique is particularly powerful because it is non-invasive and can be applied to proteins in solution, preserving their native-like behavior. When combined with other methods like hydrogen-deuterium exchange or relaxation dispersion, HP-NMR provides a multi-dimensional view of protein dynamics.

Ultimately, expanding the use of HP-NMR and similar approaches will help create the large-scale datasets needed to train predictive models of protein dynamics. This could transform our ability to design proteins with tailored functions, understand disease mechanisms, and develop new therapeutics. The future of protein science lies not just in knowing what proteins look like, but in understanding how they move.

Leptospirosis is a bacterial zoonosis caused by pathogenic spirochetes of the genus Leptospira. The disease can trigger a systemic inflammatory response syndrome due to a cytokine storm that occurs during infection. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these extensive inflammatory responses during leptospiral infection remain poorly understood.

A new study published in Antonie van Leeuwenhoek has identified a key player in this process: the HtrA protease from Leptospira interrogans. HtrA proteases are serine proteases that play important roles in bacterial stress responses and virulence. In this study, researchers found that the L. interrogans HtrA protease is a potent inducer of multifaceted cellular responses.

The study showed that HtrA protease can trigger the production of various pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in host cells. This includes cytokines like TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, as well as chemokines like IL-8 and MCP-1. The protease appears to activate multiple signaling pathways in host cells, leading to this broad inflammatory response.

Interestingly, the researchers found that HtrA protease can induce these responses even when it's not actively degrading proteins - suggesting that its inflammatory effects are independent of its protease activity. This is an important distinction, as it means the inflammatory response is triggered by the presence of the protease itself, not just its enzymatic function.

The study also demonstrated that HtrA protease can induce the production of reactive oxygen species in host cells, contributing to oxidative stress. Additionally, it can trigger the activation of transcription factors like NF-κB and AP-1, which are key regulators of inflammatory gene expression.

These findings suggest that L. interrogans HtrA protease plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of leptospirosis by inducing a multifaceted inflammatory response in host cells. This could help explain how leptospiral infections lead to the severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome observed in some cases of the disease.

Understanding the role of HtrA protease in leptospirosis pathogenesis could have important implications for developing new therapeutic strategies. If this protease is indeed a major driver of the inflammatory response, targeting it could potentially help mitigate the severe inflammatory complications of leptospiral infections.

Today we're diving into a study that explores a newly discovered xylanase enzyme from a bacterium found in the gut of a beetle. Xylanases are enzymes that break down xylan, a major component of plant hemicellulose. These enzymes are important both ecologically and industrially, as they help decompose plant material and are used in industries like biofuel production, paper processing, and food manufacturing.

The enzyme in focus comes from Agrobacterium sp. strain DKPNP3, which was isolated from the gut of Gonocephalum sp., a beetle in the order Coleoptera. The researchers conducted a comprehensive characterization of this endo-1,4-β-xylanase, using both experimental and computational approaches.

One of the key aspects of this work was the in silico structural and dynamic stability analysis. This means the team used computer modeling to predict the enzyme's three-dimensional structure and to simulate how stable it would be under various conditions. Such analyses are crucial because they help predict how well an enzyme might perform in real-world applications, especially under industrial conditions that can be harsh—like high temperatures or extreme pH levels.

The study likely involved homology modeling, where the enzyme's structure is predicted based on similarities to known xylanases, and molecular dynamics simulations, which model how the enzyme's structure changes over time. These methods can reveal insights into the enzyme's flexibility, stability, and potential active sites—information that's valuable for engineering more robust or efficient enzymes.

While the available text doesn't provide specific details on the enzyme's performance metrics or structural features, the approach taken here is significant. By combining isolation from a unique ecological niche (a beetle gut) with advanced computational analysis, the researchers are contributing to the discovery and optimization of new biocatalysts.

This work highlights the ongoing search for novel enzymes in unexpected places and the power of computational tools in modern enzyme engineering. It's a reminder that sometimes, the next big breakthrough in biotechnology might come from the gut of a beetle.

Acinetobacter baumannii has become one of the most feared pathogens in modern healthcare. This bacterium thrives in hospital environments, forms stubborn biofilms on medical devices, and has developed resistance to nearly every available antibiotic class. Carbapenem-resistant strains are now commonplace, leaving clinicians with few treatment options. The World Health Organization has classified A. baumannii as a critical priority for new antibiotic development, but the pipeline remains thin.

Bacteriophages offer a different approach. These viruses naturally infect and kill bacteria with remarkable specificity. Recent work has focused on isolating novel phages that target multidrug-resistant A. baumannii strains directly from environmental sources like sewage. Researchers have identified phages from multiple families including Autographiviridae, Myoviridae, Siphoviridae, and Friunavirus. Each shows strong lytic activity against clinical isolates.

One particularly interesting finding involves phages that encode depolymerase enzymes. These proteins can break down the polysaccharide capsules that shield A. baumannii from both immune responses and antibiotics. Phage vB_AbaM_AB4P2, for example, produces a depolymerase that degrades biofilm matrices, making bacterial communities more vulnerable to treatment.

The synergy between phages and antibiotics has emerged as a key advantage. When combined with tigecycline or meropenem, certain phages demonstrate enhanced killing compared to either agent alone. This phage-antibiotic synergy works through multiple mechanisms: phages can penetrate biofilms to deliver antibiotics deeper into bacterial communities, while antibiotics may weaken bacterial defenses against phage infection.

Testing in Galleria mellonella larvae has shown promising results, with phage-antibiotic combinations reducing bacterial loads more effectively than monotherapy. Stability studies confirm these phages remain active across a range of pH values and temperatures, supporting their potential as therapeutic agents.

Phage cocktails represent another strategic advance. By combining multiple phages with different host ranges, researchers can prevent the emergence of resistance and target diverse A. baumannii clones simultaneously. This approach addresses one of the main limitations of single-phage therapy.

The available text does not provide details on large animal model testing or human clinical trials, which remain critical next steps. Regulatory frameworks for phage therapy are still evolving, and questions about immune responses to administered phages need further investigation. Despite these uncertainties, the evidence suggests bacteriophage therapy could become a valuable tool against one of modern medicine's most challenging pathogens.

This study presents a systematic, multi-stage approach to developing novel anti-tumor agents based on rupestonic acid, a natural compound from Artemisia rupestris. The research team employed network pharmacology to predict the compound's polypharmacology mechanism, identifying 55 potential cancer-related targets. This computational prediction was followed by molecular docking studies to assess binding interactions with key proteins involved in cancer pathways.

The core innovation lies in the design and synthesis of rupestonic acid derivatives aimed at improving upon the parent compound's antitumor activity. Through this integrated strategy, the researchers identified a superior derivative that demonstrated enhanced efficacy compared to the original molecule. The work bridges traditional natural product research with modern computational drug design, using network pharmacology to guide the selection of targets and molecular docking to optimize molecular interactions.

The significance of this work extends beyond a single compound. By demonstrating how network pharmacology can inform the rational design of natural product derivatives, the study provides a template for accelerating drug discovery from traditional medicine sources. The approach addresses a critical need in oncology, where resistance to single-target therapies has driven interest in multi-target agents that can simultaneously disrupt multiple cancer pathways.

The research builds on the known cytotoxic properties of rupestonic acid while advancing the field through systematic chemical modification guided by computational predictions. This methodology represents a shift from trial-and-error synthesis toward more targeted drug development, potentially reducing the time and resources required to identify promising therapeutic candidates from natural sources.

The bank vole, *Clethrionomys glareolus*, has just joined the ranks of well-characterized mammalian genomes. Researchers have produced a chromosome-level reference assembly that spans 2.24 gigabases and resolves into 28 scaffolds corresponding to the 25 autosomes and three sex chromosomes of this species. The assembly was built using Illumina short reads for the initial contig construction, PacBio HiFi long reads for error correction and gap closure, and Hi-C data to order and orient sequences into chromosome-scale scaffolds.

Annotation was performed using a hybrid approach combining RNA-seq evidence from multiple tissues, protein homology searches against UniProt and GENCODE databases, and ab initio gene prediction. The resulting gene set is supported by both transcriptomic and comparative evidence. Genome completeness was assessed with BUSCO, yielding a score of 97.5% for mammalian single-copy orthologs, indicating that the vast majority of expected genes are present and correctly assembled.

This resource is significant because the bank vole is an emerging model for eco-evo-disease research. It plays a central role in studies of adaptive phylogeography, climate change responses, and zoonotic disease transmission, particularly hantaviruses. With a high-quality reference genome, researchers can now perform population genomic analyses to reconstruct demographic history and identify loci under selection. Functional genomic studies can link genetic variants to ecologically relevant traits such as climate adaptation and parasite resistance. Comparative genomics across rodent species becomes more robust, and mitochondrial genome assemblies can be improved.

The assembly is publicly available in GenBank under accession GCA_055000105.1, with supporting data hosted on figshare. While the source does not detail specific limitations of the assembly or annotation, the high BUSCO score and chromosome-level resolution suggest this is a reliable foundation for future work.

MurJ is a bacterial membrane protein that flips lipid-linked peptidoglycan precursors from the inner to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane. This flipping step is essential for building the bacterial cell wall, and without it, bacteria cannot maintain their shape or survive osmotic stress. Because of this critical role, MurJ has long been considered a promising target for new antibiotics.

In this study, researchers discovered that two unrelated bacteriophage proteins—LysisE from phage P1 and LysisM from phage P7—can inhibit MurJ function. These proteins are part of the phage's lysis cassette, which normally helps break open the bacterial cell to release new phage particles. But here, they found that LysisE and LysisM can block MurJ's flipping activity, leading to cell lysis even without the rest of the lysis machinery.

What makes this finding significant is that LysisE and LysisM are structurally unrelated to each other and to any known MurJ inhibitors. This suggests that nature has evolved multiple, independent ways to disrupt MurJ function—a phenomenon known as convergent inhibition. The fact that two different phages arrived at the same functional outcome through different molecular strategies hints that MurJ is under strong evolutionary pressure to be targeted, and that there may be multiple "druggable" pockets on the protein.

The researchers used a combination of genetic screens, biochemical assays, and structural biology to show that these proteins bind to MurJ and block its activity. They also demonstrated that expressing LysisE or LysisM in bacteria leads to cell death, confirming that MurJ inhibition is lethal.

This work is important because it expands the toolkit for targeting MurJ. While several small-molecule inhibitors have been developed, most bind to the same site on the protein. The discovery of these phage proteins opens up new possibilities for designing antibiotics that target different regions of MurJ, potentially overcoming resistance mechanisms.

The available text does not provide details on the specific methods used, the exact binding sites of LysisE and LysisM, or the structural basis for their inhibition. It also does not discuss potential limitations or uncertainties in the findings. However, the convergence of inhibition strategies from two unrelated phages underscores the vulnerability of MurJ and suggests that this protein remains a high-value target for antimicrobial drug development.

EZH2, or Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2, is a histone methyltransferase that plays a central role in epigenetic regulation. It catalyzes the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27, a modification that typically represses gene expression. In cancer, EZH2 is often overexpressed or mutated, leading to aberrant silencing of tumor suppressor genes. This makes it an attractive target for drug development, particularly in lymphomas and other malignancies where its activity drives disease progression.

Traditional drug discovery for EZH2 has relied heavily on structure-based design and high-throughput screening. While effective, these approaches are time-consuming and resource-intensive. The integration of deep learning into molecular design offers a way to accelerate this process by generating novel chemical structures with desired properties directly from data.

In this study, researchers developed a generative model based on a Gated Recurrent Unit, or GRU, neural network to design new EZH2 inhibitors. The model was trained on a dataset of known EZH2 inhibitors, learning the chemical patterns and structural motifs associated with activity against the target. Once trained, the GRU model could generate novel molecular structures by sampling from the learned distribution of chemical space.

The generated molecules were then evaluated using in silico methods. This included predicting their binding affinity to EZH2 through molecular docking simulations and assessing their drug-like properties using established computational filters. The prioritization step was crucial—it allowed the researchers to rank the generated compounds based on predicted activity and synthetic accessibility, narrowing down the list to the most promising candidates for further testing.

What makes this approach notable is its ability to explore chemical space beyond known scaffolds. Unlike traditional methods that often rely on minor modifications to existing molecules, the GRU-based generator can propose entirely new structures that may not have been considered otherwise. This increases the chances of discovering compounds with improved potency, selectivity, or pharmacokinetic profiles.

The study demonstrates that deep learning can be a powerful tool in the early stages of drug discovery, particularly for challenging targets like EZH2. By combining generative modeling with computational screening, researchers can efficiently identify new chemical matter with therapeutic potential. While the generated molecules still require experimental validation, the pipeline offers a scalable and innovative approach to accelerating the discovery of EZH2 inhibitors.

BioStruct-Africa's scalable framework for AlphaFold-enabled research training and sustainable workforce development in Africa

Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming structural biology, with tools like AlphaFold making protein structure prediction faster and more accessible than ever before. Yet many scientists across Africa still face significant barriers to accessing the infrastructure, training, and mentorship needed to fully leverage these advances. BioStruct-Africa has developed a community-driven framework to address this gap, integrating AlphaFold with experimental structural biology techniques such as X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, alongside drug design applications.

The initiative's effectiveness was tested through two intensive one-week workshops. A pilot was held in Douala, Cameroon, in October 2024 with 20 participants, followed by a flagship series in Nairobi, Kenya, in August 2025 that trained 101 participants from 18 African countries. The demand was striking: 198 applications were received for the 101 available spots in Nairobi, underscoring the strong appetite for this type of training across the continent.

The workshops combined lectures with hands-on sessions, and their impact was rigorously evaluated using pre- and post-training assessments, as well as anonymous surveys. In Nairobi, 71 participants responded to the survey. Learning gains were substantial, with post-training assessment scores improving by more than 10% compared to pre-training. Participant satisfaction was high, with 96% reporting that the workshop met or exceeded their expectations.

The workshops attracted a diverse group of early-career scientists, with the majority falling into the R1 category, indicating they were at the start of their research careers. Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, and Cameroon were the most represented countries. Gender balance was a priority: the Douala workshop achieved parity with 10 women out of 20 participants, while Nairobi had 40% women, reflecting the fact that all eligible women applicants were selected. Notably, male applicants made up 69% of the applicant pool in Douala and 65% in Nairobi.

By demonstrating significant learning gains, high satisfaction, and broad geographic and gender diversity, BioStruct-Africa's model validates a scalable approach to building structural biology capacity across Africa. The framework not only equips early-career scientists with cutting-edge skills but also lays the groundwork for sustained mentorship and collaboration, helping to ensure that the benefits of AI-driven structural biology are accessible to researchers across the continent.

Saracatinib, also known as AZD-0530 or SRB, is a dual-kinase inhibitor developed by AstraZeneca that targets both Src and Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinases. Despite its clinical relevance, no metabolic stability data had been reported for this compound—until now. Researchers set out to fill that gap by developing a rapid, sensitive analytical method capable of quantifying saracatinib in human liver microsome (HLM) matrix.

The team created a hydrophilic interaction ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, or UPLC-MS/MS, method. This approach combines hydrophilic interaction chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection, offering high sensitivity and selectivity for polar compounds like saracatinib. The method was specifically optimized for the HLM matrix, which contains drug-metabolizing enzymes that simulate first-pass metabolism in the liver.

After validating the method for accuracy, precision, and sensitivity, the researchers applied it to assess saracatinib's in vitro metabolic stability. This involved incubating the drug with human liver microsomes and measuring how quickly it was metabolized over time. The UPLC-MS/MS method allowed them to track even small changes in saracatinib concentration, providing reliable kinetic data.

To complement the experimental work, the team also conducted in silico predictions of metabolic lability sites. Using computational tools, they identified which parts of the saracatinib molecule were most likely to undergo metabolic transformations, such as oxidation or hydrolysis. This predictive approach helps explain the experimental results and can guide future drug design efforts.

The combination of a validated UPLC-MS/MS method and computational predictions provides a comprehensive picture of saracatinib's metabolic behavior. This work not only fills a critical knowledge gap for this clinical-stage compound but also demonstrates how analytical chemistry and computational modeling can work together to advance drug development.

Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming how we understand the relationship between genetic variation and human traits. A recent review in the Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics examines how AI technologies are advancing genotype-to-phenotype mapping across multiple domains.

The review highlights that AI's capabilities have undergone transformative growth in recent years. In human genetics, these advances are enabling researchers to better predict how genetic variations translate into observable characteristics - from disease risk to physical traits. The applications span the full spectrum of genetic analysis, including predicting the effects of single nucleotide variants, modeling complex polygenic traits, and understanding how genetic changes influence protein structure and function.

One key area where AI is making significant inroads is in predicting the functional consequences of genetic variants. Traditional computational methods often struggle with the complexity and context-dependency of genetic effects. AI models, particularly deep learning approaches, can capture these complex relationships by learning from large datasets of known variant-phenotype associations. This allows for more accurate predictions of which genetic changes are likely to be pathogenic versus benign.

The review also addresses the challenges that remain. Despite impressive progress, AI models in genetics still face limitations in interpretability - understanding exactly why a model makes a particular prediction remains difficult. There are also concerns about generalizability, as models trained on data from certain populations may not perform as well for others. Data quality and quantity continue to be bottlenecks, particularly for rare genetic variants and complex traits influenced by many genes.

The authors emphasize that AI is not replacing traditional genetic analysis but rather augmenting it. The most promising approaches combine AI predictions with experimental validation and clinical expertise. As these technologies continue to evolve, they promise to accelerate our understanding of human genetics and potentially enable more personalized approaches to medicine based on an individual's genetic profile.

Lipophilicity is a fundamental physicochemical property that significantly influences various aspects of drug behavior, such as solubility, permeability, metabolism, distribution, protein binding, and excretion. Consequently, accurate prediction of this property is critical for the successful discovery and development of new drug candidates. The classical experimental method for measuring lipophilicity is the octanol-water partition coefficient, commonly denoted as logP or logD. However, experimental determination of logP is time-consuming, expensive, and often impractical for large-scale screening during early-stage drug discovery. This has driven the development of computational methods to predict lipophilicity from molecular structure alone.

Traditional approaches to logP prediction have relied on fragment-based methods, which decompose molecules into structural fragments and sum their contributions. While these methods are interpretable, they often struggle with complex molecular structures and fail to capture subtle interactions between different parts of a molecule. More recently, machine learning approaches have emerged, leveraging molecular fingerprints and descriptors to train predictive models. However, these methods typically treat molecules as fixed-length vectors, losing important structural information about atomic connectivity and spatial relationships.

The work introduces a novel graph-based transformer architecture specifically designed for predicting the octanol-water partition coefficient. Unlike previous approaches, this method represents molecules as graphs where atoms are nodes and chemical bonds are edges. The transformer architecture then processes these molecular graphs through self-attention mechanisms, allowing the model to learn complex relationships between different parts of the molecule. This graph-based representation preserves the inherent structure of chemical compounds while enabling the model to capture long-range interactions that are crucial for determining lipophilicity.

The transformer model was trained on a large dataset of experimentally measured logP values, learning to map molecular structures to their corresponding partition coefficients. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to focus on the most relevant parts of the molecule when making predictions, similar to how chemists might consider specific functional groups or structural motifs when estimating lipophilicity manually. This approach combines the strengths of deep learning - the ability to learn complex patterns from data - with the structural awareness of graph representations.

The available text does not provide specific performance metrics or comparisons with existing methods, but the approach represents a significant methodological advance in computational chemistry. By leveraging the power of transformer architectures for molecular property prediction, this work opens new possibilities for more accurate and efficient drug discovery workflows. The graph-based representation also provides a natural way to incorporate additional molecular information, such as 3D conformations or electronic properties, potentially further improving prediction accuracy.

This research addresses a critical need in pharmaceutical development, where rapid and accurate lipophilicity prediction can accelerate the identification of promising drug candidates. The method could be particularly valuable for virtual screening campaigns, where millions of compounds need to be evaluated quickly, or for predicting properties of novel molecules that have not yet been synthesized. As drug discovery increasingly relies on computational methods, tools that can accurately predict fundamental physicochemical properties from molecular structure alone will become increasingly important for guiding experimental efforts and reducing development costs.

Mast cells are immune cells best known for their role in allergic reactions, but they also play a critical part in defending the body against pathogens. When activated, these cells release a unique form of extracellular material called mast cell extracellular granules, or MCEGs. For a long time, scientists assumed these granules were just membrane-bound packages of pre-stored inflammatory mediators. But new research published in Nature Chemical Biology reveals that MCEGs are actually something far more dynamic: they are membraneless condensates assembled through a liquid-liquid phase separation process.

The key to this discovery lies in the molecular makeup of MCEGs. These structures are rich in heparin, a highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan, and polyamines like spermidine and spermine. The researchers found that heparin and polyamines interact through electrostatic forces, forming a network that drives phase separation. This process is remarkably similar to how other cellular condensates, such as stress granules or nucleoli, form inside cells. The result is a dense, gel-like matrix that can trap and concentrate proteins, enzymes, and other bioactive molecules.

What makes this finding particularly significant is that MCEGs are not just passive storage depots. Once released into the extracellular space, they remain bioactive. The condensates can recruit and activate immune cells, release inflammatory mediators, and even modulate the local tissue environment. This means that MCEGs are not just a byproduct of mast cell activation—they are active participants in immune responses.

The study also sheds light on why heparin is so abundant in mast cells. While heparin is well-known for its anticoagulant properties, its role in forming these condensates suggests it has a broader function in organizing and regulating immune responses. The polyamines, too, are not just bystanders; they are essential for the structural integrity and function of MCEGs.

This work challenges the traditional view of mast cell granules and opens up new avenues for understanding allergic inflammation and immune defense. It also raises intriguing questions about how other extracellular condensates might function in health and disease. The available text does not provide details on the specific experimental methods used to characterize MCEGs, but the implications of this discovery are clear: mast cells use a sophisticated form of biomolecular condensation to deploy their arsenal in the fight against pathogens and allergens.

Cysteine residues are among the most chemically reactive amino acids in proteins, and their redox state is central to cellular signaling, stress responses, and metabolic regulation. A new study in Nature Chemical Biology now offers a unified chemical framework for understanding the full scope of cysteine redox biology—what the authors call the cysteine redoxome.

The core innovation here is the integration of thiol reactivity with oxoform kinetics and dynamics, mapped across the entire proteome. Traditionally, cysteine redox studies have focused on individual modifications—like oxidation to sulfenic acid, disulfide bonds, or S-nitrosylation—often in isolation. This work instead links the intrinsic chemical reactivity of each cysteine to its kinetic behavior under physiological conditions, and then connects that to real-time occupancy and flux across the proteome.

To do this, the researchers developed a suite of sulfur-specific chemical probes and quantitative mass spectrometry methods. These tools allow them to measure not just which cysteines are modified, but how fast those modifications occur, how stable they are, and how they change in response to oxidative or nitrosative stress. The result is a dynamic map of cysteine redox states that captures both steady-state occupancy and the flux of modifications—essentially, the rate at which cysteines switch between different oxidation states.

This is significant because many cellular processes, from enzyme regulation to protein-protein interactions, depend on rapid and reversible cysteine modifications. By quantifying both the thermodynamics (occupancy) and kinetics (flux), the framework provides a more complete picture of how redox signaling is encoded and decoded in cells.

The study also reveals that cysteine reactivity is not uniform across the proteome. Some cysteines are highly reactive and rapidly modified, while others are more resistant, suggesting a hierarchy of redox control points. This has implications for drug design, as targeting specific redox-sensitive cysteines could allow for precise modulation of protein function.

While the available text does not provide details on the specific chemical probes used or the exact number of cysteines analyzed, the conceptual advance is clear: by treating the cysteine redoxome as an integrated chemical system, this work sets the stage for more predictive and quantitative redox biology.
