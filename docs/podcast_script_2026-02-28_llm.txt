AlphaFold has revolutionized structural biology by making protein structure prediction fast, accurate, and accessible. But having the tool is not the same as knowing how to use it effectively. That's the gap BioStruct-Africa is addressing. The initiative is a community-driven training framework designed to bring AlphaFold-enabled structural biology to African researchers who often lack access to both the technology and the sustained mentorship needed to apply it.

The core of BioStruct-Africa's approach is a scalable, hands-on training model. It combines intensive workshops with ongoing mentorship, pairing participants with experienced structural biologists from around the world. These workshops cover not just AlphaFold, but the full workflow of structural biology—from sequence analysis and model validation to experimental techniques like X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy. The goal is to build local expertise that can sustain itself beyond the initial training.

What makes this framework different is its emphasis on long-term support. After the workshops, participants stay connected through virtual meetings, collaborative projects, and peer networks. This continuity is critical because structural biology is not a one-off skill—it requires iterative learning and troubleshooting. BioStruct-Africa also works to integrate training into local academic curricula and research programs, ensuring that new knowledge becomes embedded in the scientific culture of the region.

The initiative has already trained over 200 scientists from 18 African countries, with participants going on to lead their own research projects and train others. By focusing on both technical skills and community building, BioStruct-Africa is creating a sustainable pipeline of structural biologists who can tackle locally relevant problems—like understanding disease mechanisms in African populations or engineering proteins for agriculture and health.

In short, BioStruct-Africa is not just teaching people how to use AlphaFold. It's building a self-sustaining network of structural biologists across Africa, ensuring that the continent's scientists can fully participate in and contribute to the global structural biology revolution.

Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, but they're also highly dynamic organelles that must constantly adapt to changing cellular conditions. A new study published in Nature Structural & Molecular Biology reveals a previously unknown mechanism by which cells regulate mitochondrial protein import during stress.

The research, led by Kroczek and colleagues, identifies DNAJC15 as a key regulatory protein whose degradation under stress conditions helps cells cope with mitochondrial dysfunction. DNAJC15 is a co-chaperone that normally assists in the import of proteins into mitochondria. Under normal conditions, it helps shuttle newly synthesized proteins across the mitochondrial membranes where they can be assembled into the electron transport chain complexes that generate ATP.

However, when cells experience stress - such as nutrient deprivation, oxidative damage, or other metabolic challenges - the situation changes dramatically. The study shows that two mitochondrial proteases, OMA1 and AFG3L2, become activated and specifically target DNAJC15 for degradation. This is a critical adaptive response because when DNAJC15 levels drop, the import of new proteins into mitochondria slows down.

This might seem counterintuitive at first - why would cells want to reduce protein import when they're under stress? The answer lies in what happens to proteins that can't be properly imported. When mitochondrial import capacity is overwhelmed during stress, proteins can accumulate in the cytosol or become mislocalized. These non-imported proteins can actually trigger cellular stress responses and contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction.

By degrading DNAJC15 and thereby limiting protein import, cells effectively reduce the burden on their already stressed mitochondria. This prevents the accumulation of non-imported proteins and helps maintain mitochondrial quality control. The study also found that this mechanism is particularly important for regulating OXPHOS biogenesis - the assembly of the oxidative phosphorylation complexes that generate most of the cell's ATP.

The researchers demonstrated this mechanism using a combination of biochemical assays, proteomics, and functional studies in cultured cells. They showed that cells lacking OMA1 or AFG3L2 couldn't properly degrade DNAJC15 under stress, leading to continued protein import and accumulation of non-imported proteins. Conversely, artificially reducing DNAJC15 levels protected cells from stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.

This discovery adds an important layer to our understanding of mitochondrial stress responses. Rather than simply trying to maintain normal function during stress, cells actively reprogram their mitochondrial protein import machinery to match their reduced capacity. This represents a sophisticated quality control mechanism that helps prevent the accumulation of potentially harmful proteins while preserving mitochondrial function under challenging conditions.

The findings also have potential implications for understanding mitochondrial diseases and aging, where protein import defects and stress responses play important roles. By revealing how cells naturally regulate protein import during stress, this work opens new avenues for therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondrial dysfunction.

Robert Bullard, often called the father of environmental justice, argues that researchers in this field have more reason than ever to back up their work with action. His core claim is that environmental justice requires integrating scientific data with community-driven action—things like lawsuits and policy advocacy—to achieve transformative change. It's not enough to just do research; the work needs to move beyond the lab and into the real world to address systemic inequities in environmental, health, and civil rights protections.

The approach he champions is community-based participatory research, or CBPR. This is a "bottom-up" model where communities facing environmental hazards partner directly with researchers. Instead of scientists swooping in, collecting data, and leaving, CBPR means the community is involved from the start—helping to define the problems, shape the research questions, and use the findings to push for change. Bullard emphasizes that this partnership is essential because communities know their own needs best, and their lived experience is a critical part of the evidence.

What's new here is the call for researchers to move from being passive observers to active participants in the fight for justice. Bullard points out that while scientific data is crucial, it's only one piece of the puzzle. Real progress happens when that data is paired with community organizing, legal action, and policy advocacy. He sees this as especially urgent now, given the ongoing threats to environmental and civil rights protections.

The available text doesn't provide details on specific case studies or measurable outcomes from CBPR projects, but Bullard's argument is clear: transformative change requires both rigorous science and relentless action. Researchers need to step up, not just as experts, but as allies in the struggle for environmental justice.

The White House is holding up billions in Congressionally approved science funding, creating a bottleneck that's slowing research across the US. Despite Congress rejecting proposed budget cuts to major science agencies, the Office of Management and Budget has changed the rules on how agencies can spend their money.

Here's what's happening: In August 2025, the OMB revised a little-known document called Circular A-11, nicknamed the "Budget Bible." This document normally provides agencies with instructions on preparing budget requests and managing funds. The revision restricts the standard 30-day allotment - the automatic release of a portion of an agency's annual budget every 30 days until full spending approval. Now agencies can only spend on "essential expenses" like salaries unless they get separate OMB authorization.

The National Institutes of Health, with its $47-billion budget, hasn't received any OMB approval to spend its 2026 funds. New grant awards have slowed to a trickle - only about 30% of the new grants awarded compared to the prior six years' pace. The National Science Foundation got authorization about three weeks after the budget was signed, but before that, spending was restricted to salaries and facilities. By this point in the fiscal year, they've awarded only about 20% of their normal new grants.

NASA received full funding authorization but with a rare restriction on ten specific programs, including a Venus mission, an asteroid mission, and Earth-science satellites. The OMB is requiring more spending details before releasing those funds.

This represents a drastic departure from historical practice. The delays are disrupting research timelines, university planning, and scientist careers. The OMB hasn't responded to queries about when agencies might get approval to spend their funds.

The timing is particularly problematic following a 43-day government shutdown in October and November 2025 that already paused grant reviews and agency work. Now, even with Congress having allocated the money, the White House is effectively controlling how and when it gets spent, potentially steering funds away from programs it opposes.

This is a story about a scientific paper that's now under scrutiny 23 years after it was published. In 2003, researchers reported that a gene product called Murr1 could restrict HIV-1 replication in resting CD4+ lymphocytes. That finding was significant because resting CD4+ T cells are a major reservoir for latent HIV, and understanding how to block viral replication in these cells has been a key goal in HIV research.

Now, in 2026, the editors of Nature have issued an expression of concern about that 2003 paper. The concern centers on Figure 3b, where they've identified that the control panels were duplicated. This means the same image or data was presented more than once, likely in error, which raises questions about data integrity.

Here's the problem: the raw data from the original experiments is no longer available. Because the paper is so old, the original datasets can't be retrieved for verification. This makes it impossible to determine whether the duplication was a simple clerical error or if it points to a deeper issue with the data.

The expression of concern does note that Figures 3c and 3d contain separate, independent panels that confirm the specificity of the gene knockdown using two reference genes, Skp1 and Actin. These controls were not duplicated, which suggests at least some parts of the experiment were conducted independently.

An expression of concern is not a retraction. It's a formal notice to readers that there's a potential issue with the published work. In this case, the editors are alerting the scientific community that a specific figure in the paper may not be reliable, and that the underlying data can no longer be checked.

The original claim—that Murr1 restricts HIV-1 replication in resting CD4+ lymphocytes—remains scientifically plausible, but this expression of concern means readers should interpret the evidence in that paper with caution. Without access to the raw data, the scientific community can't independently verify the findings, and that uncertainty will likely persist.

Pokémon turns 30 this year, and Nature has published a fascinating look at how this fictional universe of pocket monsters has shaped real-world science. The connection runs deeper than you might expect.

Take Spencer Monckton, an entomologist who discovered a new bee species with an unusually elongated face. He named it *Chilicola charizard* after the fire-breathing Pokémon, citing the creature's distinctive snout as the inspiration. This isn't just a quirky naming choice—it represents how Pokémon's visual language has become embedded in scientific thinking.

The Field Museum in Chicago has taken this connection even further with their exhibition "Pokémon and the Real-Life Fossils They're Based On." They're showing visitors how creatures like Aerodactyl draw directly from pterosaurs, while Archeops mirrors the ancient bird *Archaeopteryx*. It's a clever way to teach paleontology through a medium that already captures people's imaginations.

But perhaps the most striking evidence comes from a 2002 survey of UK children aged 4 to 11. Researchers found that kids could name significantly more Pokémon characters than local wildlife species. This wasn't just about memorization—it revealed how effectively Pokémon's design principles engage young minds with classification and biodiversity concepts.

Scientists have leveraged this engagement for education. The "Phylo" card game uses Pokémon-style mechanics to teach ecosystem building, food chains, and environmental threats like climate change and oil spills. Players learn about species interactions and conservation while having fun—essentially gamifying ecological education.

The Pokémon franchise has sold over 500 million games worldwide, creating a massive cultural touchstone. For an entire generation of scientists who grew up catching virtual creatures, Pokémon provided an early framework for understanding biological diversity, classification systems, and the thrill of discovery. As these researchers now work in fields from evolutionary biology to biodiversity conservation, they're bringing that childhood fascination into their professional work—proving that sometimes, the line between play and science is thinner than we think.

For decades, biologists have known that some genes can act selfishly, manipulating inheritance to boost their own transmission even at a cost to the organism. In insects and mice, these so-called sex distorters can skew offspring ratios dramatically—sometimes producing broods that are 90 percent male or female. But in humans, despite decades of speculation, no clear case had ever been documented—until now.

A new analysis of the Utah Population Database, which contains genealogical records stretching back to the late 1700s, has uncovered what researchers believe is the first conclusive example of a human sex distorter gene. The study examined more than 26,000 paternal lineages, looking for families with an unusually high proportion of male offspring. Out of all those lineages, only one passed two independent statistical tests for a genuine, non-random male bias.

In this single family, spanning seven generations and over 200 years, the numbers are striking: 60 recorded male births versus just 29 female births. That's roughly a two-to-one ratio favoring boys—far outside what you'd expect from random chance. The researchers went to great lengths to rule out other explanations. They checked for historical events like wars or famines that might have disproportionately affected female infants, investigated whether female infanticide could have played a role, and even considered whether the practice of polygamy in early Utah might have skewed the data. None of these factors explained the pattern.

What makes this finding particularly compelling is that the bias appears to be tied to the Y chromosome, which is passed only from father to son. That suggests a genetic element that somehow increases the likelihood of Y-bearing sperm fertilizing the egg, or perhaps gives male embryos a developmental advantage. The exact mechanism remains unknown—the study identifies the statistical signal but not the specific mutation responsible.

This discovery matters because it confirms a long-standing theoretical prediction: that selfish genetic elements can operate in humans, not just in fast-breeding species like fruit flies. It also raises new questions about how such genes persist. If they bias reproduction so strongly, why haven't they spread through the population or been eliminated by natural selection? The answer likely involves complex trade-offs we don't yet understand.

Of course, this is still a preprint, meaning it hasn't been peer-reviewed yet. And it's based on a single family from one population, so we don't know how common such distorters might be elsewhere. But if confirmed, it would be a landmark finding—showing that the same evolutionary forces shaping sex ratios in insects and mice are also at work in our own species, hidden in plain sight within family trees.

In 1973, geneticist Lionel Penrose published a paper in The Lancet titled "Fingerprints and palmistry" that documented correlations between genetic abnormalities and the creases of the hand. This work represents a fascinating intersection of genetics and what might seem like pseudoscience, and it's the subject of historian Alison Bashford's exploration of how scientists and physicians have interpreted hand features across different eras.

The available text doesn't specify which genetic abnormalities Penrose studied or the strength of these correlations. However, the fact that a respected geneticist published this work in a major medical journal suggests there was some empirical basis for his observations. The paper appears to have been Penrose's final publication before his death, giving it a certain historical significance in the field.

What makes this topic particularly interesting is how it sits at the intersection of legitimate scientific inquiry and the long human tradition of reading meaning into hand features. Physicians, embryologists, endocrinologists, psychiatrists, and physical anthropologists have all contributed to this body of knowledge over time. The hand has served as a kind of biological text that different disciplines have tried to decode.

Bashford's book, as reviewed here, traces this history of interpretation. It's not just about Penrose's work but about the broader cultural and scientific fascination with the hand as a site of biological information. The review suggests the book examines how various experts have approached the hand - from medical professionals looking for diagnostic signs to anthropologists studying human variation.

The limitations of what we can say from this brief review are significant. We don't know Bashford's specific conclusions about the validity of these interpretations, whether she critiques past practices, or what her overall argument is. The review doesn't provide details about the methodologies used by different researchers or the specific findings that have emerged from this long tradition of hand analysis.

What we can say is that this represents a curious chapter in the history of science - one where the boundaries between legitimate medical observation and more speculative interpretation have often been blurry. The hand, with its unique patterns of creases and fingerprints, has captured human attention for millennia, and Bashford's work apparently examines how that attention has manifested in scientific practice over time.

Here's a deep-dive segment based on the provided information:

Intermittent fasting, a popular dietary intervention, has been shown to have unexpected consequences for long-term immune memory. A recent study published in Nature reveals that fasting initiated more than eight weeks after vaccination or infection can actually reduce the number of long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow, leading to a decrease in antigen-specific antibodies and impaired humoral immune memory.

The research team used multiple mouse models to test the effects of fasting on established humoral immunity. They vaccinated mice with various antigens, including NP-KLH, inactivated influenza vaccine, and the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine Ad5-nCoV. Additionally, they infected a separate cohort with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). The key was to initiate intermittent fasting protocols, such as alternate-day fasting or prolonged fasting, more than eight weeks after vaccination or infection. This timing was crucial as it targeted pre-existing, antigen-specific long-lived plasma cells.

The results were striking. Mice that underwent fasting more than eight weeks post-immunization showed reduced levels of antigen-specific IgG in their serum. Furthermore, there was a noticeable decrease in the number of antigen-specific long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow. This reduction in long-lived plasma cells translated to practical consequences. For instance, influenza-vaccinated mice that were subjected to late fasting had reduced protection when subsequently challenged with the influenza virus. Similarly, SARS-CoV-2-vaccinated mice showed decreased serum neutralization activity against a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus after undergoing late fasting.

The study also found that mice with prior LCMV infection that underwent alternate-day fasting or prolonged fasting more than eight weeks post-infection had reduced serum levels of anti-LCMV antibodies.

These findings suggest that while intermittent fasting may have various health benefits, it could potentially compromise long-term immune memory if initiated too long after vaccination or infection. This research highlights the complex interplay between dietary interventions and immune function, underscoring the need for a nuanced understanding of how lifestyle choices can impact our immune system's ability to maintain long-term protection against pathogens.

The rapid emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with spike protein mutations has undermined the effectiveness of current vaccines, necessitating innovative strategies to ensure broad and lasting immunity. This study leverages an immunoinformatics approach to design two multi-epitope vaccine constructs, Cov19-B and Cov19-T, targeting the spike protein's most notable mutations.

The spike protein is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies, but its high mutation rate allows the virus to evade immune responses. To address this, the researchers used computational tools to identify conserved and variant epitopes—short amino acid sequences that can trigger immune responses—across multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. They focused on mutations in the receptor-binding domain and N-terminal domain, which are critical for viral entry and immune recognition.

Cov19-B is a 649-amino-acid, 74-kDa construct designed to include a broad range of epitopes from both conserved and variable regions of the spike protein. Cov19-T is a smaller 465-amino-acid version optimized for T-cell responses. Both constructs were engineered with adjuvants—molecular boosters like flagellin and β-defensin—to enhance immune activation. The designs also incorporated linkers and tags to improve stability and expression in host cells.

The immunoinformatics pipeline involved multiple steps: retrieving spike protein sequences from global databases, aligning them to identify mutation hotspots, predicting B-cell and T-cell epitopes using machine learning algorithms, and assessing their binding affinity to human leukocyte antigens (HLAs). The final constructs were evaluated for allergenicity, toxicity, and population coverage across diverse HLA types.

While the study provides a detailed computational framework, it does not include experimental validation such as in vitro or in vivo testing. The available text does not provide details on the specific mutations targeted or the exact epitopes selected. However, the approach represents a scalable method to design variant-proof vaccines by integrating real-time genomic surveillance with epitope prediction.

If validated experimentally, these multi-epitope vaccines could offer broader protection against current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants, reducing the need for frequent booster updates. The study underscores the potential of immunoinformatics to accelerate vaccine design in response to rapidly evolving pathogens.

Cryptosporidium hominis and Cryptosporidium parvum are two of the most common species causing cryptosporidiosis, a diarrheal disease that affects both humans and animals. The parasite infects the intestinal epithelium, leading to severe diarrhea, dehydration, and in immunocompromised individuals, potentially life-threatening illness. In children, repeated infections can impair growth and cognitive development. Despite its global health burden, there is currently no FDA-approved vaccine for cryptosporidiosis, and treatment options are limited.

To address this gap, researchers developed a novel mRNA-based multiepitope vaccine candidate targeting both C. hominis and C. parvum. The vaccine was designed using reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics approaches. Reverse vaccinology involves screening the entire genome of a pathogen to identify potential vaccine antigens, while immunoinformatics uses computational tools to predict which epitopes—specific parts of antigens that trigger immune responses—are most likely to be effective.

The vaccine candidate includes multiple epitopes from conserved proteins of both Cryptosporidium species, aiming to provide broad protection. By using mRNA technology, the vaccine delivers genetic instructions to host cells to produce these antigens, prompting a strong immune response without using live pathogens. This approach is similar to the mRNA vaccines developed for COVID-19, offering rapid development and scalability.

The available text does not provide details on the specific epitopes selected, the vaccine's immunogenicity in preclinical models, or its efficacy in preventing infection. However, the use of mRNA technology and multiepitope design represents a promising strategy for developing a vaccine against these challenging gut pathogens. If successful, this vaccine could significantly reduce the global burden of cryptosporidiosis, particularly in vulnerable populations such as young children and immunocompromised individuals.

CAR-M therapy, or chimeric antigen receptor macrophage therapy, has emerged as a promising approach for treating liver fibrosis. The basic idea is to engineer macrophages—immune cells that can engulf debris and modulate inflammation—to target fibrotic tissue more effectively. In liver fibrosis, excessive scar tissue builds up, impairing organ function, and current treatments are limited.

The challenge with CAR-Ms so far has been their limited anti-inflammatory capacity once they reach the fibrotic sites. Even though they can be directed to the right location, their ability to switch the local environment from pro-fibrotic to anti-fibrotic hasn't been strong enough to achieve robust therapeutic effects.

The new work addresses this by engineering CAR-Ms to express TRIM13, a protein known as tripartite motif containing 13. TRIM13 is involved in regulating cellular stress responses and can influence inflammatory signaling pathways. By introducing TRIM13 into CAR-Ms, the researchers aimed to enhance the cells' ability to adopt an anti-inflammatory phenotype once they arrive in fibrotic tissue.

The approach involves modifying the genetic program of the macrophages so that TRIM13 is actively expressed. This change appears to shift the balance of signals the CAR-Ms produce, tipping them toward an anti-inflammatory state. In the context of liver fibrosis, this means the engineered cells are better equipped to reduce scar formation and promote tissue repair.

What's notable here is that the innovation isn't just about targeting—CAR-Ms already do that—but about fundamentally altering their functional capacity once they're on site. By boosting their anti-inflammatory potential through TRIM13, the engineered cells can more effectively counteract the fibrotic process.

This strategy could make CAR-M therapy more potent for liver fibrosis and potentially other fibrotic diseases where inflammation drives tissue damage. The available text does not provide details on the specific experimental results or the magnitude of the therapeutic improvement, but the concept of using TRIM13 to reprogram CAR-M function represents a targeted enhancement of an existing cell therapy platform.

Acute ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death and permanent disability worldwide, and while the initial blockage of blood flow causes immediate damage, it's the secondary effects—particularly neuroinflammation—that often drive long-term brain injury. Now, a new review in CNS Drugs is exploring whether a class of drugs already used for lowering cholesterol could also help limit this inflammatory cascade.

The drugs in question are PCSK9 inhibitors—monoclonal antibodies that block proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, or PCSK9. Most people know PCSK9 for its role in cholesterol control: it binds to and promotes the degradation of LDL receptors, which reduces the liver's ability to clear LDL cholesterol from the blood. That's why blocking PCSK9 with drugs like evolocumab or alirocumab can dramatically lower LDL levels and reduce cardiovascular risk.

But the review highlights a growing body of evidence that PCSK9's influence extends well beyond lipid metabolism. In the brain, PCSK9 is expressed in neurons, microglia, and endothelial cells, and it appears to modulate inflammatory signaling pathways. After a stroke, levels of PCSK9 in the brain and blood spike. This increase seems to exacerbate neuroinflammation by promoting microglial activation, increasing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and disrupting the blood-brain barrier.

The review synthesizes findings from preclinical models showing that inhibiting PCSK9—either genetically or with monoclonal antibodies—can reduce infarct size, improve neurological outcomes, and dampen the inflammatory response after ischemic injury. Some studies even suggest that PCSK9 inhibition may promote neurogenesis and support blood-brain barrier repair.

What's compelling is that these drugs are already FDA-approved, well-tolerated, and have a known safety profile in humans. That means, in theory, they could be rapidly repurposed for stroke therapy if clinical trials confirm the neuroprotective effects seen in animals.

The review does note that most of the evidence so far comes from small animal models, and human data are still lacking. Questions remain about the optimal timing for administration, the best drug candidates, and whether the benefits extend to all stroke subtypes. Still, the convergence of lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory effects makes PCSK9 inhibitors a promising candidate for protecting the brain in the critical hours and days following an ischemic stroke.

AHT-102 is a bispecific antibody designed to target both the tumor-associated antigen CLDN18.2 and the T-cell marker CD3. This dual-targeting approach aims to recruit T cells directly to tumor cells, enabling localized immune attack. Claudin18.2 is a tight junction protein that is highly expressed in gastric and other gastrointestinal cancers, but largely absent in normal tissues, making it an attractive therapeutic target.

The preclinical evaluation of AHT-102 was conducted in humanized mouse models of gastric cancer. These models are particularly valuable because they incorporate human immune cells, allowing for a more accurate assessment of how the bispecific antibody interacts with the human immune system in a tumor context. The study focused on several key aspects: pharmacokinetics, anti-tumor efficacy, tissue distribution, and safety profile.

In terms of pharmacokinetics, AHT-102 showed favorable properties, with sustained presence in the bloodstream and effective penetration into tumor tissues. This is critical for ensuring that the antibody can reach and engage its targets over an extended period. The tissue distribution data indicated that AHT-102 preferentially accumulated in tumor sites, which is a desirable feature to maximize therapeutic effect while minimizing off-target exposure.

The anti-tumor efficacy results were promising. AHT-102 demonstrated significant tumor growth inhibition in the humanized mouse models, suggesting that it can effectively harness T-cell mediated cytotoxicity against CLDN18.2-expressing cancer cells. This is particularly important given the challenges that CD3-engaging bispecific antibodies often face in solid tumors, where the tumor microenvironment can suppress immune responses.

Safety was a major focus of the evaluation, especially given the known risks of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) associated with CD3-engaging antibodies. The preclinical data indicated that AHT-102 had a manageable safety profile, with lower incidence or severity of CRS compared to some other bispecific antibodies in development. This is likely due to its design, which may include features that limit systemic T-cell activation and promote localized immune responses.

Overall, the preclinical data for AHT-102 suggest that it has the potential to be an effective and safe therapeutic option for CLDN18.2-positive gastric cancers. The combination of targeted tumor cell killing, favorable pharmacokinetics, and a manageable safety profile positions AHT-102 as a promising candidate for further clinical development. The available text does not provide details on the specific design features that contribute to its safety profile, but the results indicate that these features are effective in preclinical models.

PAK4 is a serine-threonine kinase that belongs to the group II p21-activated kinase family. It is activated by small GTPases like Cdc42 and Rac1, which are part of the Rho family of signaling proteins. PAK4 is highly expressed in metabolic tissues such as the liver, adipose tissue, and pancreas, where it plays a central role in integrating nutrient signals with cellular metabolism.

In the liver, PAK4 regulates glucose production and lipid metabolism. It modulates the activity of key transcription factors like FOXO1 and SREBP1c, which control gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis, respectively. In adipose tissue, PAK4 influences adipocyte differentiation and insulin sensitivity. It also affects mitochondrial function and energy expenditure, which are critical for maintaining metabolic homeostasis.

In pancreatic beta cells, PAK4 is involved in insulin secretion and beta cell survival. It helps maintain the structural integrity of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for the proper release of insulin in response to glucose. Dysregulation of PAK4 in these cells can lead to impaired insulin secretion and contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes.

PAK4's role in metabolic diseases is further highlighted by its involvement in obesity and insulin resistance. Studies have shown that PAK4 expression is upregulated in obese individuals and in animal models of diet-induced obesity. This upregulation is associated with increased inflammation and oxidative stress in metabolic tissues, which are key drivers of insulin resistance.

The therapeutic potential of targeting PAK4 in metabolic diseases is an active area of research. Small molecule inhibitors of PAK4 have been developed and tested in preclinical models. These inhibitors have shown promise in improving insulin sensitivity, reducing hepatic steatosis, and promoting weight loss. However, the long-term effects and safety of PAK4 inhibition in humans remain to be fully elucidated.

In summary, PAK4 is a key regulator of metabolic processes in the liver, adipose tissue, and pancreas. Its dysregulation contributes to the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases such as obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. Targeting PAK4 with specific inhibitors represents a potential therapeutic strategy for these conditions, but further research is needed to fully understand its role and develop safe and effective treatments.

Leptospirosis is a bacterial zoonosis caused by pathogenic spirochetes of the genus Leptospira. It can trigger a systemic inflammatory response syndrome due to a cytokine storm during infection. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the extensive inflammatory responses during leptospiral infection remain poorly understood.

In this study, researchers investigated the role of the HtrA protease from Leptospira interrogans in inducing cellular responses. HtrA proteases are serine proteases that play important roles in bacterial stress responses and virulence. The researchers found that the L. interrogans HtrA protease is a potent inducer of multifaceted cellular responses.

Specifically, they discovered that HtrA protease triggers the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α in human cells. These cytokines are key mediators of the inflammatory response and can contribute to the cytokine storm observed in severe leptospirosis cases. The researchers also found that HtrA protease activates the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is a major regulator of inflammation and immune responses.

Furthermore, the study revealed that HtrA protease induces the expression of adhesion molecules like ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 on the surface of endothelial cells. These molecules facilitate the adhesion and transmigration of immune cells to the site of infection, contributing to the inflammatory process.

The researchers also investigated the impact of HtrA protease on the integrity of the endothelial barrier. They found that HtrA protease disrupts the tight junctions between endothelial cells, leading to increased permeability of the endothelial layer. This disruption of the endothelial barrier can contribute to the leakage of fluids and immune cells into the surrounding tissues, exacerbating the inflammatory response.

Overall, this study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which L. interrogans HtrA protease induces multifaceted cellular responses during leptospirosis infection. The findings highlight the importance of HtrA protease as a virulence factor and suggest potential therapeutic targets for managing the inflammatory complications associated with leptospirosis.

The available text does not provide details on the specific experimental methods used in the study or the exact concentrations of HtrA protease that were tested. Additionally, the text does not mention any potential therapeutic interventions or strategies to mitigate the inflammatory effects of HtrA protease. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the complex interactions between L. interrogans HtrA protease and host cells, as well as to explore potential therapeutic approaches for managing leptospirosis-induced inflammation.

Here's the deep dive segment:

In a recent study published in Communications Chemistry, researchers tackled a fundamental challenge in structural biology: how to accurately model the multiple conformational states that proteins can adopt. This is crucial because proteins aren't static structures - they shift between different shapes to perform their functions, and understanding these transitions is key to developing targeted therapies.

The team focused on extracting coevolutionary constraints from homologous protein sequences. When proteins evolve, certain amino acids tend to change together across different species - if one position mutates, another often compensates to maintain the protein's function. These coevolutionary patterns encode valuable information about which parts of the protein are structurally or functionally linked.

To capture these patterns automatically, the researchers employed MSA Transformer, a transformer-based model that uses attention mechanisms to learn relationships between positions in multiple sequence alignments. Unlike traditional methods that might miss subtle correlations, transformer architectures excel at identifying complex dependencies across long protein sequences.

The approach represents a significant advance because it can potentially reveal not just a single static structure, but the ensemble of conformations a protein can adopt. This is particularly important for understanding mechanisms like allostery, where binding at one site affects function at a distant site through conformational changes.

While the available text doesn't provide specific results or quantitative comparisons, the methodology addresses a critical gap in protein modeling. Most structural prediction tools focus on predicting a single "best" structure, but many proteins function through dynamic transitions between multiple states. By leveraging evolutionary information through modern machine learning approaches, this work points toward more nuanced models of protein behavior that could ultimately improve our ability to design drugs that target specific conformational states.

The study was published in Communications Chemistry, though the exact publication date isn't specified in the available information.

Acinetobacter baumannii is a notorious multidrug-resistant pathogen that has become a major threat in healthcare settings worldwide. Its ability to form robust biofilms on medical devices and resist multiple antibiotics makes it particularly dangerous for immunocompromised patients. In response to this growing challenge, researchers have turned to phage therapy as a potential solution.

A new study published in Molecular Biology Reports details the isolation and characterization of a novel bacteriophage called AbT1, which shows promise in combating A. baumannii infections. The phage was isolated from environmental samples and demonstrated specific lytic activity against A. baumannii strains. What makes AbT1 particularly interesting is its ability to not only kill planktonic bacteria but also to disrupt established biofilms - those slimy, protective layers that bacteria form to shield themselves from antibiotics and the immune system.

The researchers evaluated AbT1's anti-biofilm activity and found that it could penetrate and degrade existing biofilms, making the bacteria within more susceptible to treatment. Even more importantly, they discovered that when AbT1 was used in combination with certain antibiotics, the synergistic effect was significantly greater than either treatment alone. This suggests that phage-antibiotic combinations could be a powerful strategy for treating stubborn A. baumannii infections.

The study represents an important step forward in developing alternative therapies for multidrug-resistant bacteria. While the available text doesn't provide specific details about the phage's genome, host range, or exact mechanisms of biofilm disruption, the findings highlight the potential of phage therapy as part of a broader strategy to combat antimicrobial resistance. The researchers emphasize that further studies will be needed to optimize dosing regimens and evaluate safety in clinical settings, but AbT1 shows clear promise as a tool in the fight against one of modern medicine's most challenging pathogens.

This is a tricky one. What we have here is not an article at all, but a bibliography or reference list. There's no actual research content to analyze—no methods, no results, no discussion of mechanisms or therapeutic potential. The snippet mentions that ANGPTL7 is involved in angiogenesis, tissue homeostasis, inflammation, glucose and lipid metabolism, and disease regulation, but that's just a generic statement from a reference list, not a detailed scientific finding.

Without the full article text, we can't say what specific mechanisms were studied, what experiments were done, or what the key evidence actually shows. We also can't assess limitations or explain why this particular work matters beyond the general fact that ANGPTL7 is biologically active in multiple systems.

If you have access to the full text of the paper, that would let us extract the actual core claim, methods, and findings. Otherwise, all we can do is acknowledge that this is a reference entry pointing to a study on ANGPTL7, but we can't summarize its content or significance without the article itself.

This paper is not actually available in the provided text. What we have here is a bibliography of references related to the cGAS-STING pathway and ISGylation, but not the full article itself. So I can't extract the core claim, methods, or key evidence from the actual study.

However, I can explain what this research area is about based on the references listed. The cGAS-STING pathway is a crucial immune signaling system that detects foreign or misplaced DNA in the cell's cytoplasm. When activated, it triggers inflammatory responses including type I interferon production, which helps fight infections and cancer.

The paper appears to focus on how ISGylation - the process of attaching the ISG15 protein to other proteins - stabilizes STING and prevents its degradation through autophagy. This is important because STING protein levels naturally decline in many cancers, including lung cancer, which limits the effectiveness of immunotherapies that try to activate this pathway.

The references show this is part of a broader field studying how to maintain STING stability for better cancer treatment. Some papers discuss STING agonists - drugs that activate STING - while others examine how cells naturally regulate STING through processes like ESCRT-dependent degradation, which breaks down STING to terminate signaling.

The novelty here seems to be identifying ISGylation as a protective mechanism for STING, rather than just focusing on how to activate STING or block its degradation. By preventing autophagic degradation, ISGylation could help maintain STING levels and enhance antitumor immunity in lung cancer.

Rupestonic acid, a natural product from Artemisia rupestris L., has emerged as a promising scaffold for developing multitargeting anti-tumor agents. A recent study combined network pharmacology and molecular docking to guide the design and synthesis of novel derivatives, aiming to enhance the compound's therapeutic potential against cancer.

The research began with network pharmacology to map rupestonic acid's polypharmacological profile. This computational approach identified 55 potential cancer-related targets, revealing the compound's ability to interact with multiple proteins involved in tumor progression. Molecular docking then predicted binding affinities between rupestonic acid and these targets, highlighting key interactions that could be optimized through structural modification.

Based on these insights, researchers synthesized a series of rupestonic acid derivatives with varied substituents. The goal was to improve binding to critical targets while maintaining or enhancing the compound's drug-like properties. In vitro testing against multiple cancer cell lines showed that several derivatives exhibited superior anti-proliferative activity compared to the parent compound. The most potent derivative demonstrated IC50 values in the low micromolar range against hepatocellular carcinoma cells, suggesting strong potential for further development.

Mechanistic studies revealed that the derivatives modulate key signaling pathways, particularly PI3K/AKT, which is frequently dysregulated in cancer. This pathway inhibition leads to reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in tumor cells. The study also found evidence of effects on other cancer-related processes, including cell cycle regulation and metastasis-related protein expression.

What makes this work particularly valuable is the integration of computational prediction with experimental validation. By using network pharmacology to guide synthesis, the researchers could focus on the most promising structural modifications, significantly reducing the trial-and-error typically involved in drug development. This approach demonstrates how natural product scaffolds like rupestonic acid can be systematically optimized for improved therapeutic outcomes.

The findings suggest that rupestonic acid derivatives represent a new class of multitargeting anti-cancer agents with potential applications beyond hepatocellular carcinoma. Future work will likely focus on in vivo efficacy studies and further optimization of the lead compounds identified in this study.

Here's what we know about EMMVEP from the available text: nothing. The source document provided is just a list of references and citations. There's no actual article content describing the method, its approach, key evidence, or why it matters.

This is a common issue when dealing with academic papers - sometimes what gets indexed or shared is just the bibliography rather than the full text. Without the actual paper, we can't tell you what EMMVEP is, how it works, what makes it novel, or what results it achieved.

The title suggests it's an ensemble method for predicting protein missense variant effects using multi-source feature fusion, but that's just speculation based on the name. We don't know if it uses machine learning, what features it considers, how it performs compared to existing tools, or what its limitations might be.

The RSS snippet mentions that missense mutations are common in the coding genome and can alter protein functions, and that distinguishing pathogenic from benign variants remains challenging.

The bank vole, Clethrionomys glareolus, has emerged as a powerful non-model organism for integrative research in evolutionary biology, ecology, and disease. This status is primarily due to the availability of a high-quality chromosome-level reference genome and a rich history of population genomic and phylogeographic studies. The 2.24 Gb assembly is resolved into 28 chromosome-scale scaffolds, providing a robust foundation for functional and comparative genomic analyses.

The primary method used to generate this resource was de novo genome sequencing and assembly using short-read Illumina data, with long-range linkage achieved via an in vitro method such as Chicago or Hi-C. The assembly's completeness was evaluated using BUSCO, ensuring high-quality coverage of single-copy orthologs. Population genomics and phylogeography were conducted using mitochondrial DNA sequences and nuclear genome-wide markers, such as SNPs, from samples across the species' range. Genic distribution modeling was also employed to predict climate change adaptation.

Decades of phylogeographic research have identified multiple glacial refugia, including Mediterranean, Carpathian, and a northern refugium, and complex postglacial colonization routes shaping the species' genomic diversity. Studies have demonstrated local adaptation to climate, including functional divergence in haemoglobin genes between lineages from different refugia. The species is a natural host for hantaviruses and is used as a model for studying parasite-host interactions and eco-immunology during biological invasions.

The bank vole system provides a real-world model to understand how historical climate change, specifically Pleistocene glaciations, shapes contemporary genomic diversity and adaptive potential. This directly informs predictions of future biodiversity responses to climate change and the dynamics of zoonotic disease reservoirs in changing environments. The genomic resource enables functional studies linking genotype to phenotype in a wild mammal.

However, the conclusions are specific to one rodent species, and generalizability to other non-model organisms requires validation. While a reference genome exists, functional validation of candidate adaptive variants, such as via gene editing or physiological studies, is implied as a future need but not detailed in the provided text. The focus is on European populations, and genomic diversity and adaptation in other parts of the range, such as Asia, are less covered.

EZH2, or Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2, is a histone methyltransferase that plays a critical role in epigenetic regulation. It's been implicated in various cancers, making it an attractive target for drug development. The challenge, however, lies in designing effective inhibitors that can selectively bind to EZH2 and modulate its activity.

Traditional drug discovery methods can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. That's where deep learning comes in. By leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, researchers can accelerate the process of identifying potential drug candidates. In this study, the authors employed a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based model to generate novel EZH2 inhibitors.

GRUs are a type of recurrent neural network that excel at processing sequential data, such as chemical structures. By training the model on a dataset of known EZH2 inhibitors, the researchers were able to generate new molecular structures that have the potential to bind to EZH2. This de novo design approach allows for the exploration of a vast chemical space, potentially uncovering novel scaffolds that might have been overlooked by traditional methods.

But generating new molecules is only half the battle. The next step is to prioritize these candidates based on their likelihood of being effective inhibitors. This is where in-silico prioritization comes into play. By using computational methods to predict the binding affinity and other properties of the generated molecules, researchers can focus their efforts on the most promising candidates.

The study's approach combines the strengths of deep learning and computational chemistry to streamline the drug discovery process. By generating and prioritizing novel EZH2 inhibitors in silico, the researchers can significantly reduce the time and resources required for experimental validation.

It's important to note that while this study demonstrates the potential of using deep learning for de novo drug design, the generated molecules still need to be experimentally validated. The in-silico

Let me walk you through a fascinating intersection of computational chemistry and phototherapy that could reshape how we treat certain genetic disorders.

The core innovation here is using azobenzene-based molecules as light-controlled switches for ion channels. These are proteins that act like gates in cell membranes, controlling the flow of ions like sodium and potassium. When these channels malfunction, it can lead to serious conditions including epilepsy, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and cystic fibrosis.

The breakthrough approach combines three computational methods: quantum mechanical calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and hybrid QM/MM simulations. Think of it as using different lenses to examine the same problem - from the quantum level of electron behavior to the larger-scale movements of entire protein structures.

Here's why this matters: current photoswitchable molecules have two major limitations. First, they don't always switch cleanly between their two forms - you get unwanted byproducts. Second, they require specific wavelengths of light that may not penetrate tissue well or could damage cells.

The computational approach helps solve these problems by predicting how chemical modifications to the azobenzene structure will affect both its light-switching behavior and its interaction with target proteins. For instance, quantum mechanical calculations can reveal how electron distribution changes during photoisomerization, while molecular dynamics shows how the molecule moves and binds within the protein channel.

The review emphasizes that successful design requires considering the biological context - how these molecules actually behave inside living cells, not just in isolated test tubes. This is where the QM/MM hybrid method becomes crucial, bridging the gap between quantum-level electronic changes and larger protein movements.

Machine learning enters the picture as a screening tool, potentially accelerating the search through vast chemical space to find promising candidates. However, the review notes that optimal integration strategies for this specific application remain to be fully developed.

The ultimate goal is personalized, reversible treatments where doctors could use light to precisely control ion channel activity without invasive procedures. Imagine treating a seizure by shining specific wavelengths of light to modulate neural activity, or managing cystic fibrosis by controlling chloride channels in lung tissue.

While the computational framework is promising, significant hurdles remain. The translation from computational predictions to actual therapeutics is complex, and we still lack detailed metrics on current performance gaps. But by combining computational insights with experimental validation, researchers are making tangible progress toward light-controlled treatments for these challenging disorders.

Lipophilicity is one of those fundamental physicochemical properties that quietly governs so much of how a drug behaves in the body. It influences solubility, how well a molecule crosses membranes, its metabolic fate, where it distributes, how tightly it binds to proteins, and ultimately how it's excreted. That's why predicting the octanol-water partition coefficient—logP—accurately is such a critical step in early drug discovery. Get it wrong, and you risk downstream failures in development.

The team behind this work took a graph-based transformer approach, specifically fine-tuning a pre-trained Graphormer model—called GraphormerMapper—for the task of logP prediction. They named the resulting model GraphormerLogP. The choice of Graphormer is interesting because it's designed to capture both local and global structural features of molecules through attention mechanisms applied to molecular graphs, which can encode richer chemical information than traditional descriptors.

To test performance, they compiled a new dataset of 42,006 unique SMILES-logP pairs from public sources, which they call the GLP dataset. They also used a separate benchmark dataset of 13,688 molecules for validation. The model was pitted against several established methods: Random Forest, Chemprop, CheMeleon, StructGNN, and Attentive FP.

The results were competitive, and in some cases superior. On the GLP dataset, GraphormerLogP achieved a mean absolute error of 0.251. On the benchmark dataset, the MAE was 0.269. These numbers are strong, especially considering the diversity and size of the datasets used.

What makes this approach stand out is the fine-tuning of a pre-trained transformer on molecular graphs, which allows the model to leverage learned representations from a broader chemical space before specializing in logP prediction. This could mean better generalization to novel scaffolds or underrepresented chemical classes.

The GLP dataset is publicly available on GitHub, which is a nice touch for reproducibility and further benchmarking. While the paper doesn't dive into failure cases or limitations, it's worth noting that transformer-based models can be computationally heavier than simpler methods, and their interpretability remains a challenge.

Still, for drug discovery teams looking to improve early-stage property prediction, GraphormerLogP offers a compelling, data-driven tool that balances accuracy with the ability to capture complex molecular features.

Mast cells are immune cells that release membraneless mast cell extracellular granules, or MCEGs, in response to allergic inflammation and pathogen infection. These granules are found to be condensates formed by heparin and polyamines, and they remain bioactive after release.

The core innovation here is that heparin, a highly negatively charged glycosaminoglycan in mast cell granules, forms liquid-like condensates with polyamines. These condensates assemble into membraneless extracellular granules that retain biological activity after release. This is a significant departure from the traditional view of mast cell granules as simply membrane-bound vesicles.

The available text does not provide details on the specific polyamines involved, the exact mechanism of condensate formation, or the biological functions of these extracellular granules. However, the finding that heparin and polyamines can form liquid-like condensates that assemble into bioactive extracellular granules represents a novel understanding of mast cell biology and immune responses.

This work suggests that mast cell extracellular granules are not just passive containers of inflammatory mediators, but rather active, membraneless condensates that can participate in immune responses. The liquid-like nature of these condensates may allow for rapid assembly and disassembly, potentially enabling dynamic regulation of immune responses.

The implications of this discovery extend beyond basic immunology. Understanding the formation and function of these bioactive condensates could lead to new therapeutic strategies for allergic diseases and other conditions involving mast cell activation. Additionally, this work highlights the importance of phase separation in immune cell biology, a field that has seen growing interest in recent years.

While the available text does not provide specific details on the experimental methods or results, the core finding that heparin and polyamines form bioactive condensates in mast cell extracellular granules represents a significant advance in our understanding of mast cell biology and immune responses.

Cysteine residues are the chemical workhorses of cellular redox biology, and recent advances in chemical proteomics are finally giving us the tools to map their full functional landscape. The cysteine redoxome encompasses all the reversible post-translational modifications that occur on these sulfur-containing amino acids, including sulfenylation, S-nitrosylation, persulfidation, and glutathionylation. These modifications act as molecular switches, regulating everything from enzyme activity to protein-protein interactions in response to oxidative and nitrosative stress.

The challenge has always been technical: cysteines exist in multiple oxidation states simultaneously, and traditional proteomics methods struggle to distinguish between them or quantify their occupancy at specific sites. That's where activity-based protein profiling comes in. Researchers now use libraries of cysteine-reactive electrophilic probes that can selectively label different redox states. For example, aryl-nitroso compounds specifically target sulfenic acids, while certain Wittig reagents can capture persulfides. These probes are designed with enrichment handles that allow mass spectrometry-based identification and quantification of modified cysteines across entire proteomes.

The analytical workflow typically involves treating cells or tissues with these probes, enriching the labeled proteins, and then using tandem mass spectrometry with data-independent acquisition to identify modification sites. Isotopic labeling strategies like iodoTMT or cysTMTRAQ enable precise quantification of modification stoichiometry - essentially telling us what fraction of each cysteine is modified under different conditions. This is crucial because a cysteine that's 90% modified likely has a different functional role than one that's only 5% modified.

What makes this approach particularly powerful is its ability to link chemical reactivity with biological function. Quantitative reactivity profiling with probe libraries can predict which cysteines are functionally important and potentially druggable. Studies have shown that cysteines with high intrinsic reactivity tend to be more functionally significant and more likely to be targeted by small molecules. This has implications for drug discovery, as it helps identify which cysteines might be viable targets for covalent inhibitors.

The field is also benefiting from computational advances. Tools for predicting cysteine pKa values help researchers understand which residues are more likely to be reactive under physiological conditions. Database resources like CysDB compile information on known cysteine modifications, helping researchers interpret their results in a broader biological context.

Recent work has revealed that cysteine sulfenylation - the oxidation of thiols to sulfenic acids - is far more widespread than previously thought and plays crucial roles in regulating key signaling proteins. For instance, site-specific analysis has shown how sulfenylation of EGFR regulates its kinase activity and downstream signaling. Similarly, S-nitrosylation has been implicated in numerous physiological processes, from synaptic plasticity to cardiovascular function.

The implications extend beyond basic biology. Dysregulation of cysteine redox modifications has been linked to numerous diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular disease. Understanding the redoxome could lead to new therapeutic strategies that target these modifications directly. Moreover, as we age, the balance of redox modifications shifts, suggesting that the redoxome may play a role in the aging process itself.

What's emerging is a picture of the cell as a highly dynamic redox network, where cysteine modifications serve as rapid, reversible switches that allow cells to respond to environmental changes. The ability to map this network site-specifically and quantitatively represents a major advance in our understanding of cellular regulation and opens new avenues for therapeutic intervention.

When we think of fractures, we usually picture broken bones or cracked sidewalks—damage to be avoided. But in the developing embryo, fracturing is not just inevitable—it's essential. A growing body of research shows that controlled fracturing is a fundamental mechanism for shaping tissues and organs, turning what looks like destruction into a precise sculpting tool.

The key insight is that tissues are not static. They grow, stretch, and accumulate internal stresses. When those stresses exceed the material limits of the tissue, fractures occur—but these fractures are not random failures. They follow predictable physical rules and often open up new spaces or guide the formation of complex structures.

One striking example comes from early mouse embryos. As cells divide, fluid accumulates between them, forming small bubbles. These bubbles don't just sit there—they merge through a process called Ostwald ripening, where smaller bubbles are absorbed into larger ones. This creates internal pressure. When the pressure gets high enough, the tissue fractures—but not randomly. The fracture preferentially occurs along the path of least resistance, often into weaker cells. This controlled hydraulic fracture reliably positions the blastocoel cavity, a fluid-filled space critical for further development. Without this fracture, the embryo would not form the right internal architecture.

In zebra fish, the developing heart offers another example. As the heart begins to beat, mechanical strain concentrates in the outer curvature of the tube-shaped organ. This strain causes fractures in the cardiac jelly—a gelatinous scaffold that supports the heart tube. These fractures are not defects; they guide the looping and folding that transform the straight tube into the complex, four-chambered heart. The heart literally breaks itself into shape.

These findings challenge the traditional view of morphogenesis as purely a matter of genes and chemical signals. Instead, they highlight the role of physics—specifically, the mechanics of soft materials under stress. Tissues behave like viscoelastic materials: they can stretch and flow like liquids over long timescales, but fracture like solids when stressed quickly. This duality allows them to both grow and reshape themselves in response to internal and external forces.

Researchers are now combining high-resolution live imaging—capturing mouse embryos every minute or zebra fish hearts at up to 100 frames per second—with custom-built tools that apply controlled mechanical strain. They also use genetic engineering to create chimeric embryos and engineer organs with altered shapes, then watch how fractures guide their development. Physics-based simulations, borrowing from materials science and soft matter physics, help predict where and how fractures will occur.

The implications go beyond embryology. Understanding how controlled fracturing shapes tissues could inform regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, and even the treatment of developmental disorders. It also offers a new perspective on evolution: perhaps some of the most elegant solutions in biology are not about avoiding breakage, but about breaking in just the right way.

Deep learning is revolutionizing protein design, making once-daunting challenges routine. A new review in *Current Opinion in Structural Biology* highlights how advanced computational methods are transforming protein-binder engineering, enabling researchers to design proteins that interact with unprecedented precision. These advances promise to accelerate drug discovery and therapeutic development by allowing scientists to create custom proteins for specific medical applications. The field is rapidly evolving, with AI-driven approaches opening new possibilities for tackling complex biological problems that were previously out of reach.

Researchers have discovered that protein language models can distinguish between catalytic and structural zinc-binding sites in proteins, a task that has long challenged scientists. Using ESM-2 embeddings, the team achieved high accuracy in classifying these functionally distinct sites, despite their similar coordination geometries. This breakthrough, reported in the *Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling*, could improve our understanding of protein function and aid in drug design by helping researchers identify which zinc sites are involved in chemical reactions versus those that provide structural support.

Scientists have uncovered how a single amino acid difference determines whether antibodies can bind to different filoviruses. A new crystal structure reveals that a nanobody targeting Marburg virus fails to cross-react with Měnglà virus due to just one amino acid variation. Published in *ACS Infectious Diseases*, this finding highlights the molecular precision required for antibody development and could inform the design of broader-spectrum treatments for these deadly viruses, which include Ebola and Marburg.

Researchers have used structural modeling and molecular simulations to reveal how nanobody-based quenchbodies work as fluorescent sensors. These sensors detect target molecules by using tryptophan residues that quench attached fluorophores, with fluorescence increasing when the target binds. The study in the *Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling* focused on interleukin-6 sensors, showing how antigen binding displaces the fluorophore to produce a measurable signal. This work provides crucial insights for optimizing these biosensors for medical diagnostics and research applications.
