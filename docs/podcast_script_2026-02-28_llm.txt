Robert Bullard, often called the father of environmental justice, has spent decades arguing that scientific research alone cannot dismantle environmental racism. His work began in the late 1970s in Houston, Texas, where he documented a stark pattern: solid-waste landfill sites were disproportionately located in predominantly Black neighborhoods. This wasn't just an academic observation—it became the foundation for lawsuits and policy changes that directly challenged those inequities.

Bullard's 1990 book *Dumping in Dixie* chronicled how five predominantly Black communities in the southern United States mobilized to combat deadly pollution. The book didn't just catalog problems; it showed how communities paired data with direct action—lawsuits, protests, and policy advocacy—to achieve measurable change. That marriage of research and activism became the movement's blueprint.

The approach he champions is community-based participatory research, driven from the bottom up. Communities partner with academic researchers to define the questions, collect the data, and package the findings for policymakers. This isn't about researchers parachuting in to study a problem and leaving. It's about treating the environment as everywhere people live, work, learn, play, and worship—and ensuring those most affected have a seat at the table from day one.

Bullard points to five HBCU-based centers, like the Environmental Justice Resource Center at Clark Atlanta University, as the intellectual backbone of the movement. These institutions didn't just produce studies; they trained activists, shaped policy, and kept the pressure on polluters and policymakers.

The core argument is simple but radical: data without action is incomplete. Researchers in environmental justice have more reason than ever to back up their work with lawsuits, policy advocacy, and community organizing. Because without that next step, the patterns Bullard first documented in Houston will keep repeating—just with different zip codes.

The White House is blocking the release of Congressionally-approved 2026 science budgets, creating a major disruption in federal research funding. The Office of Management and Budget has altered standard procedures, preventing agencies like the NIH, NSF, and NASA from accessing their approved appropriations.

This represents a fundamental shift in how federal budgets are executed. Normally, agencies receive automatic 30-day funding increments to maintain operations. Now, the OMB has revised Circular A-11 - essentially the federal budget bible - to restrict these increments to only "essential expenses" like salaries. Everything else requires additional justification.

The practical impact is severe. The NIH has received zero approval to spend its 2026 appropriations. It can only issue new grants using carryover funds from previous years, effectively freezing new research initiatives. NASA faces even more targeted restrictions - the OMB used a footnote in a budgetary notice to explicitly withhold spending authority for ten specific programs until agency officials provide further justification.

This isn't just bureaucratic delay. Congress already rejected sweeping cuts to science agencies, approving budgets that reflected legislative priorities. By blocking release of these funds, the executive branch is effectively overriding Congressional decisions on research funding levels.

The timing creates particular hardship. Research institutions typically plan their grant cycles and hiring around predictable federal funding patterns. This uncertainty makes it impossible to commit to new projects or personnel, potentially causing talented researchers to leave the field or relocate internationally.

What makes this especially concerning is the precedent it sets. If executive agencies can unilaterally block Congressionally-approved science funding, it undermines the legislative branch's constitutional authority over appropriations. The available text doesn't indicate how long these restrictions might last or what specific criteria agencies must meet to regain full spending authority.

In 2003, a study published in Nature claimed that a protein called Murr1 could restrict HIV-1 replication in resting CD4+ T cells. Now, more than two decades later, the journal has issued an expression of concern about that paper. The editors flagged a problem in Figure 3b, where control panels appear to have been duplicated. That's a serious issue because those controls were meant to validate the specificity of the Murr1 siRNA knockdown experiments.

The notice points out that separate panels in Figures 3c and 3d independently confirm specificity using two reference genes, Skp1 and Actin. But here's the catch: the raw data from the original study is no longer available. Without it, there's no way to verify whether the duplicated panels were just a clerical error or if they mask deeper problems with the data.

This matters because HIV research is a high-stakes field. If Murr1 really does block HIV in resting CD4+ cells, that could point to new therapeutic targets. But if the key evidence is unreliable, then the entire foundation of that claim is shaky. The editors aren't retracting the paper—they're just flagging the uncertainty. That's a crucial distinction. An expression of concern doesn't mean the conclusions are false, but it does mean readers should treat the findings with caution.

The unavailability of raw data is a recurring problem in older studies. Labs close, data gets lost, and sometimes the original researchers move on. That's why modern journals now require data preservation policies. In this case, the missing data leaves a hole that can't be filled, and the scientific community is left to weigh the rest of the evidence without being able to fully verify the most contentious part.

Pokémon turns 30 this year, and Nature is taking a look at how this fictional universe of pocket monsters has shaped real-world science. The Japanese media franchise, launched in 1996, has grown into a global phenomenon with video games, trading cards, movies, and merchandise. But beyond entertainment, Pokémon has left a surprising mark on scientific research, taxonomy, museum exhibitions, and science education.

Scientists interviewed for the piece describe how Pokémon mirrors their professional work. The act of collecting and classifying Pokémon species parallels the work of entomologists and taxonomists who catalog real organisms. One researcher noted that the game's emphasis on evolution and biodiversity provided an early framework for understanding these concepts. This connection is so strong that some scientists have named real species after Pokémon. For example, the bee *Chilicola charizard* was named after the iconic fire-breathing Pokémon.

Museums have also embraced Pokémon as a teaching tool. The Field Museum in Chicago created an exhibition linking Pokémon designs to real fossil taxa. Aerodactyl, a flying Pokémon, was compared to pterosaurs, while Archeops was linked to *Archaeopteryx*, one of the earliest known birds. These connections help visitors see the parallels between fictional creatures and real evolutionary history.

Educational studies highlight Pokémon's impact on scientific literacy. A 2002 UK survey found that children could name more Pokémon than local wildlife species. This insight led to the development of the "Phylo" card game, a Pokémon-inspired educational tool designed to teach ecosystems, food chains, and environmental threats. The game uses familiar Pokémon mechanics to engage players in real ecological concepts.

The significance of Pokémon's influence lies in its demonstration of how pop culture can scaffold public scientific engagement. By providing a familiar framework, Pokémon has helped translate childhood interests into sustained scientific literacy and even career paths. It offers a model for designing effective science communication tools that leverage existing cultural familiarity.

However, the evidence is largely anecdotal, based on self-reported influence from a specific subset of scientists—those who were Pokémon fans and chose to comment. While compelling, this limits the generalizability of the findings.

As Pokémon celebrates its 30th anniversary, its legacy in science is clear: a fictional world that has inspired real-world curiosity, education, and discovery.

A seven-generation Utah family has produced the first clear evidence in humans of a potential Y-chromosome "sex distorter" gene - a type of "selfish gene" that biases its own transmission by producing more male offspring. Researchers analyzing anonymized genealogical data from the Utah Population Database found one family with a sustained male-biased sex ratio of 60 males to 29 females across seven generations.

The study focused on paternal lineages because Y-chromosome-based sex distorters are theoretically easier to detect in genealogical records than X-chromosome distorters. The researchers applied two statistical tests to recorded sexes of 76,445 individuals across more than 26,000 paternal lineages, looking for families with male bias unlikely to occur by chance.

What makes this finding significant is that sex distorters have been documented in other species - from fruit flies to mice - but never conclusively in humans. These genes can spread through populations by biasing their own transmission, often at the expense of the organism's overall fitness. In this case, the Y-chromosome variant appears to be passed down through male descendants, consistently producing more sons than daughters.

The researchers acknowledge that the effect could be due to factors other than a genetic distorter. Environmental influences, cultural practices, or even reporting biases in historical records could potentially explain the pattern. The study's authors note that while the statistical evidence is compelling, they cannot definitively prove the mechanism without genetic testing of living family members.

Some researchers remain skeptical, pointing out that the study relies entirely on historical records and cannot account for miscarriages or stillbirths, which could skew the apparent sex ratio. The available text does not provide details on what the two statistical tests were or their specific parameters. Without access to the full methodology, it's difficult to assess how robust these findings are to potential confounding factors.

If confirmed, this would represent a major discovery in human genetics, demonstrating that selfish genetic elements can operate in our species just as they do in other animals. The Utah Population Database, with its extensive genealogical records spanning centuries, provided a unique opportunity to detect such subtle genetic effects that might otherwise go unnoticed in shorter time frames or smaller populations.

Let's start with Alison Bashford's exploration of how scientists and physicians have historically interpreted the human hand. The core idea here is that features like palm creases and fingerprints have been read as physical codes revealing internal states, genetics, or character. Bashford frames this as a history of reading the body's "mysterious, curious, and often complex codes."

A key figure in this story is geneticist Lionel Penrose, who in 1973 published correlations between genetic abnormalities and hand creases in a Lancet paper titled "Fingerprints and palmistry." This work sits at the intersection of legitimate science and the pseudoscience of palmistry, showing how physical traits have been used to infer internal conditions. The available text doesn't detail Bashford's full chronological scope or other key figures, but the focus is on how these interpretations reflect broader histories of medicine, anthropology, and pseudoscience.

Next, human geographer Wim Carton and human ecologist Andreas Malm present a stark framework for climate action. Given that mitigation efforts have failed to meet climate targets, they argue the world must urgently focus on three remaining options: adaptation, carbon dioxide removal, and solar geoengineering. Their analysis is grounded in the reality of continued fossil fuel dominance, exemplified by the statistic that in 2023, the United States "pumped more oil and gas than any country had ever done in history." This pragmatic approach influences policy and public discourse on emergency responses to likely overshooting temperature goals. The text doesn't provide specific critiques of these options or detailed proposals, but it underscores the urgency of the situation.

Finally, archaeologist Eric H. Cline examines the Amarna letters—clay tablets with cuneiform script—as a window into Bronze Age diplomacy. These letters, exchanged between Egyptian pharaohs and other Near Eastern rulers, reveal the complexities of ancient international relations. Cline's analysis highlights how these documents provide insights into the political, economic, and cultural interactions of the time. The available text doesn't detail specific arguments or the book's chronological scope, but it emphasizes the importance of these letters in understanding ancient diplomacy.

This study computationally designed two multi-epitope vaccine constructs targeting conserved and mutation-derived epitopes from the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein of the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Omicron variants, aiming to elicit broad humoral and cellular immunity against evolving strains.

The researchers began by analyzing the spike protein sequences from four major SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. They identified both conserved regions that remain stable across variants and mutation-derived epitopes that represent the evolving viral landscape. Using immunoinformatics tools, they predicted which of these epitopes would be most likely to trigger strong immune responses.

From this analysis, they constructed two vaccine candidates. Cov19-B contains 649 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 74 kilodaltons. Cov19-T is smaller at 465 amino acids. Both constructs incorporate multiple epitopes designed to activate different arms of the immune system - some for antibody production and others for T-cell responses.

The computational modeling showed that these vaccine constructs have favorable properties for vaccine development. They demonstrated good solubility, which is crucial for manufacturing. The structures showed stable folding patterns that would likely maintain their shape after administration. Most importantly, the epitope selection aimed to cover the diversity of circulating variants while including conserved elements that might protect against future mutations.

The researchers validated their designs through multiple computational steps. They assessed antigenicity to ensure the constructs would be recognized by the immune system. They evaluated allergenicity to minimize adverse reactions. They also analyzed the potential for these epitopes to bind to various human leukocyte antigen types, which is essential for triggering T-cell immunity across diverse populations.

While these are still computational designs without experimental validation, the approach represents a strategic response to the challenge of viral evolution. By incorporating both conserved and variant-specific epitopes, the vaccines aim to provide protection against current strains while maintaining efficacy as the virus continues to mutate.

The COVID-19 pandemic has driven an unprecedented surge in antiviral drug discovery, with researchers targeting both SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human host factors to control viral infection. This massive effort has produced thousands of potential drug candidates and involved thousands of patients in clinical trials, representing one of the largest coordinated antiviral development campaigns in history.

The review from Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy examines the current landscape of antiviral drug development, highlighting both the progress made and the persistent challenges in the field. One key insight is that while the pandemic accelerated development timelines, it also exposed fundamental limitations in our approach to antiviral therapeutics.

Traditional antiviral drug discovery has relied heavily on targeting viral proteins directly. However, this approach faces significant hurdles. Viruses mutate rapidly, leading to drug resistance. Many viral proteins lack suitable binding pockets for small molecules. And the narrow therapeutic window between viral inhibition and host toxicity remains a persistent problem.

The review emphasizes that targeting human host proteins represents a promising alternative strategy. Since host factors are less prone to mutation than viral proteins, drugs targeting these pathways could potentially offer broader protection against multiple viral variants. Several host-targeted approaches have shown promise, including drugs that interfere with viral entry, replication, or the host immune response.

However, host-targeted therapies come with their own challenges. These drugs must be carefully designed to avoid disrupting essential cellular functions. The review notes that combination therapies targeting both viral and host factors may offer the best approach, potentially reducing resistance development while maintaining efficacy.

Looking forward, the authors identify several critical needs for the field. First, there's a pressing need for better predictive models to identify which drug candidates are most likely to succeed in clinical trials. Second, the development of broad-spectrum antivirals that can target multiple viruses would provide crucial preparedness for future pandemics. Third, improved understanding of viral-host interactions at the molecular level could reveal new therapeutic targets.

The review also addresses the economic and logistical challenges of antiviral development. Unlike antibiotics, which have a large market, antivirals for rare or emerging viruses often lack commercial incentives for development. This creates a fundamental mismatch between public health needs and market forces.

One of the most significant insights from the pandemic response is the importance of platform technologies that can be rapidly adapted to new viral threats. mRNA vaccine technology demonstrated this potential, and similar platform approaches for small molecule drugs could revolutionize our ability to respond to emerging viral threats.

The authors conclude that while the COVID-19 pandemic has advanced our understanding of antiviral drug development, much work remains to be done. The field needs to move beyond the traditional one-bug, one-drug paradigm toward more sophisticated approaches that can address the complex challenges of viral infections in the modern world.

Cryptosporidium hominis and Cryptosporidium parvum are two of the most common species causing cryptosporidiosis, a diarrheal disease that affects both humans and animals. The parasite is transmitted through contaminated water or food, and in immunocompromised individuals, it can lead to severe, life-threatening illness. Despite its public health impact, there is currently no FDA-approved vaccine for cryptosporidiosis, which makes this work particularly significant.

The researchers took a modern approach by combining reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics to design a multiepitope mRNA vaccine. Reverse vaccinology starts with the pathogen's genome to identify potential antigens, while immunoinformatics uses computational tools to predict which of those antigens are most likely to trigger a strong immune response. This method allows for a more targeted and rational vaccine design compared to traditional approaches.

The vaccine candidate they developed targets both C. hominis and C. parvum, aiming to provide broad protection against the two most relevant species. By focusing on multiepitope design, the vaccine includes multiple antigenic targets, which could help overcome the parasite's ability to evade the immune system through antigenic variation.

The study's pipeline involved screening the genomes of both species to identify conserved proteins, predicting epitopes that would bind to human MHC molecules, and then assembling these epitopes into a single mRNA construct. This mRNA-based platform is particularly promising because it can be rapidly produced and modified if needed, and it has already proven successful in other infectious disease vaccines.

While the available text does not provide details on the specific antigens chosen, the immunogenicity results, or the in vivo efficacy of the vaccine, the approach itself represents a significant step forward. If successful, this mRNA-based multiepitope vaccine could fill a critical gap in preventing cryptosporidiosis, especially in vulnerable populations and in settings where the disease is endemic.

Liver fibrosis is a major global health problem, and while chimeric antigen receptor macrophages—CAR-Ms—have shown promise in targeting fibrotic tissue, their effectiveness has been limited by their inability to fully adopt an anti-inflammatory phenotype once they reach the fibrotic site. A new study in Nature Communications addresses this by engineering a way to reprogram macrophages directly inside the body using a specially designed lipid nanoparticle.

The researchers developed an ROS-responsive lipid nanoparticle—called ESLNP—that can deliver mRNA systemically to macrophages already present in fibrotic tissue. Once inside, the mRNA encodes both a chimeric antigen receptor and a protein called TRIM13. TRIM13 is known to regulate inflammatory responses, and here it was used to push the macrophages toward a more anti-inflammatory state. This in situ reprogramming means the macrophages don't just arrive at the fibrotic site—they arrive ready to act, with both the targeting capability of CAR-Ms and the enhanced anti-inflammatory capacity needed to suppress fibrosis.

The CAR component is designed to recognize and eliminate activated hepatic stellate cells, which are the main drivers of fibrosis in the liver. By combining this targeting with TRIM13-mediated anti-inflammatory reprogramming, the engineered macrophages can more effectively reduce scar tissue formation and promote liver repair.

This approach is significant because it overcomes a key limitation of earlier CAR-M therapies: the inability to control macrophage phenotype after delivery. Instead of relying on ex vivo engineering and reinfusion, this method reprograms macrophages in their native environment, potentially making the therapy more scalable and less invasive.

The available text does not provide details on the specific lipid composition of ESLNP, the exact mRNA payload size, or the in vivo efficacy metrics such as fibrosis reduction percentages or survival outcomes. However, the core innovation—using ROS-responsive nanoparticles for targeted, phenotype-modifying mRNA delivery to macrophages in fibrotic tissue—represents a promising advance in cell therapy for liver disease.

PON-Del is a new computational tool designed to predict whether short protein deletions—specifically those that remove one to ten amino acids—are likely to be pathogenic or benign. This is a significant challenge in genomics because deletions are among the most common types of genetic variation, yet many are misclassified in databases, especially when the mRNA transcript is degraded by cellular quality-control mechanisms.

The team behind PON-Del built a comprehensive dataset of 4,243 short in-frame deletions, drawing from major variant databases like ClinVar, LOVD, dbSNP, and UniProtKB. These deletions were mapped to MANE-selected transcripts to ensure consistency. From this dataset, they extracted 611 features across four categories: context-based features (like sequence conservation around the deletion), content-based features (such as the biochemical properties of the deleted segment), protein structure-based features, and functional annotation-based features.

To train and validate the predictor, they used a machine learning approach, specifically a random forest classifier, which is well-suited for handling the complex, non-linear relationships in biological data. The model was rigorously tested using cross-validation and independent test sets to ensure robustness.

PON-Del stands out because it not only provides binary predictions (pathogenic or benign) but also a three-state classification that includes variants of uncertain significance (VUS). This is particularly useful for clinical interpretation, where uncertainty is common. When compared to existing tools, PON-Del demonstrated superior performance, especially in distinguishing pathogenic deletions from benign ones.

The tool is freely available as a web service, making it accessible to researchers and clinicians worldwide. This is important because accurate classification of protein deletions can inform diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment decisions in genetic disorders.

In summary, PON-Del represents a significant advance in the field of variant interpretation, offering a more accurate and nuanced approach to predicting the impact of short protein deletions. Its development underscores the importance of integrating diverse biological data and advanced machine learning techniques to tackle complex problems in genomics.

Protein structure prediction has made incredible strides in recent years. With tools like AlphaFold, we can now predict a protein's 3D structure from its amino acid sequence with remarkable accuracy. But structure is only part of the story. Proteins are not static molecules—they flex, shift, and undergo conformational changes that are essential for their function. Predicting these dynamic behaviors from sequence alone remains a major challenge.

To tackle this, researchers need a much larger experimental database linking protein sequence, dynamics, and function. That's where high-pressure nuclear magnetic resonance, or HP-NMR, comes in. This technique applies pressures up to several kilobars to protein samples while monitoring their behavior using NMR spectroscopy. The high pressure can shift the equilibrium between different conformational states, revealing hidden dynamics that are invisible under normal conditions.

The key insight is that pressure changes the volume of different protein states. If a protein can exist in two forms—say, a compact folded state and a more extended unfolded state—applying pressure will favor the more compact form. By systematically varying pressure and observing how the NMR signals change, scientists can map out the energy landscape of these transitions. This provides direct experimental data on how sequence influences dynamics.

What makes HP-NMR particularly powerful is its ability to detect rare or transient states. Many functionally important protein motions occur on timescales or in populations too small to observe with conventional methods. High pressure can stabilize these fleeting states long enough to study them in detail. This opens a window into the molecular mechanisms of processes like enzyme catalysis, protein folding, and allostery.

The available text does not provide details on specific proteins studied or quantitative results, but the broader implication is clear: HP-NMR is a valuable tool for building the experimental database needed to understand—and eventually predict—protein dynamics. As this database grows, it will feed back into computational models, helping bridge the gap between static structure prediction and dynamic function prediction. In the long run, this could transform our ability to design proteins with tailored functions for medicine, biotechnology, and beyond.

This paper tackles a fundamental challenge in structural biology: how to accurately model the multiple conformational states that proteins adopt during their functional cycles. Proteins aren't static structures - they flex, bend, and shift between different shapes as they perform their biological roles. Understanding these conformational changes is critical for developing targeted therapies and deciphering protein mechanisms.

The approach builds on a powerful concept from evolutionary biology: coevolutionary constraints. When proteins evolve, amino acids that interact or depend on each other tend to change together across species. By analyzing these patterns across homologous sequences, researchers can infer structural and functional relationships. The innovation here is using MSA Transformer, a transformer-based model that leverages attention mechanisms to automatically capture these coevolutionary patterns from multiple sequence alignments.

What makes this work particularly relevant is the growing recognition that many proteins function through conformational heterogeneity - existing in multiple states simultaneously rather than switching between discrete forms. Traditional structural biology methods often struggle to capture this complexity, typically providing static snapshots that miss the dynamic nature of protein function.

The paper appears to focus on disentangling these coevolutionary constraints to better model conformational heterogeneity. This suggests developing methods to separate different types of evolutionary pressures - perhaps distinguishing between constraints that maintain core structure versus those that enable functional flexibility.

While the specific technical details and results aren't available from the provided text, the approach represents an important direction in computational structural biology. By combining evolutionary information with modern machine learning architectures, researchers are developing more sophisticated tools for understanding protein dynamics - work that could ultimately lead to better drug design and a deeper understanding of biological mechanisms.

Here's a deep-dive segment based on the provided information:

Today we're looking at a comprehensive computational study of an endo-1,4-β-xylanase enzyme from Agrobacterium sp. strain DKPNP3, which was isolated from the gut of Gonocephalum sp. beetles. This work, published in Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, represents a significant advance in understanding how this enzyme functions at both structural and dynamic levels.

Xylanases are crucial enzymes that break down xylan, a major component of plant hemicellulose. These enzymes have substantial industrial and ecological importance, particularly in biofuel production, paper processing, and waste management. What makes this study particularly interesting is that the enzyme comes from a bacterium found in beetle guts, suggesting potential applications in understanding insect-plant interactions and biomass degradation in natural systems.

The researchers conducted an in silico analysis, which means they used computational methods to examine the enzyme's structure and stability. This approach allows for detailed examination of molecular interactions and dynamics that would be difficult to observe experimentally. The study likely involved molecular dynamics simulations to understand how the enzyme behaves over time, as well as structural analysis to identify key features that contribute to its stability and function.

While the specific computational methods aren't detailed in the available text, such studies typically examine factors like protein folding, active site architecture, and interactions with substrates or inhibitors. The researchers would have been particularly interested in understanding what makes this xylanase stable and effective, especially given its origin in the harsh environment of an insect gut.

This kind of computational characterization is increasingly important as we seek to engineer better enzymes for industrial applications. By understanding the fundamental properties of naturally occurring xylanases, researchers can work toward designing more efficient variants for specific uses.

The available text doesn't provide details on the specific findings or conclusions of the study, but the comprehensive nature of the characterization suggests this work could provide valuable insights for both basic research and applied biotechnology.

Acinetobacter baumannii is a nightmare pathogen for modern medicine. It's a Gram-negative bacterium that thrives in hospital environments, forms stubborn biofilms on medical devices, and has developed resistance to virtually every antibiotic we throw at it. Carbapenem resistance is now common, and colistin resistance is emerging. The World Health Organization has classified it as a critical priority pathogen. When standard antibiotics fail, mortality rates can exceed 50 percent.

This is why bacteriophage therapy is getting serious attention again. Phages are viruses that specifically infect and kill bacteria. They're everywhere in nature, highly specific, and can evolve alongside their bacterial hosts. The research we're looking at today focuses on isolating new phages that target multidrug-resistant A. baumannii and testing them both alone and in combination with antibiotics.

The approach starts with environmental sampling - sewage, hospital wastewater, soil - places where phages that prey on hospital-associated bacteria might be found. Researchers isolate phages that can infect A. baumannii strains, then sequence their genomes to ensure they don't carry genes for antibiotic resistance or toxin production. The goal is therapeutic phages that are safe and effective.

Several novel phages have been characterized. Some belong to the Autographiviridae family, others to Myoviridae or Siphoviridae. These phages show strong lytic activity against MDR A. baumannii strains. But the real innovation goes beyond simple phage therapy. Many of these phages encode depolymerases - enzymes that break down the polysaccharide capsules that A. baumannii uses to shield itself from both immune responses and antibiotics.

The biofilm problem is particularly challenging. A. baumannii biofilms can be up to a thousand times more resistant to antibiotics than planktonic cells. Phages with depolymerase activity can penetrate these biofilms, degrading the extracellular matrix and exposing the bacteria within. This makes the bacteria vulnerable again to both the phage and to antibiotics.

The most promising results come from phage-antibiotic synergy. When phages are combined with antibiotics like tigecycline or meropenem, the bacterial load drops significantly more than with either treatment alone. The mechanism appears to be that phages weaken the bacteria by killing some cells and disrupting biofilms, while antibiotics mop up the survivors. This synergy has been demonstrated in vitro and in the Galleria mellonella wax moth larvae model, which is increasingly used as a surrogate for mammalian infection studies.

Phage cocktails represent another strategic advance. Using multiple phages with different host ranges prevents the rapid emergence of resistance that can occur with single phages. If bacteria evolve resistance to one phage, others in the cocktail can still infect them. This approach also broadens the spectrum of A. baumannii strains that can be targeted.

Stability testing shows these phages remain active across a range of pH values and temperatures, which is crucial for developing practical therapeutic formulations. They can be stored and potentially administered in various ways - topically for wound infections, systemically for bacteremia, or as coatings for medical devices.

The limitations are significant, though. Most data comes from test tube experiments and insect models. We don't yet have robust mammalian data, let alone human clinical trials. The regulatory framework for phage therapy is still evolving - each phage product is essentially a biological drug that may need individual approval. Phage resistance can still emerge, even with cocktails. And we don't fully understand how the human immune system responds to large doses of administered phages - will patients develop neutralizing antibodies? Will there be inflammatory reactions?

Despite these uncertainties, the evidence suggests that phage therapy, particularly when combined with antibiotics and engineered to include depolymerase activity, represents a viable strategy for combating multidrug-resistant A. baumannii. As antibiotic resistance continues to spread, these viral predators may become essential weapons in our antimicrobial arsenal.

The bank vole, a small rodent native to Europe and Asia, has become an important model for studying how wild mammals adapt to environmental change and interact with pathogens. Now researchers have delivered a high-quality reference genome that will accelerate work in this area.

The new assembly reaches chromosome-level resolution, meaning the 2.24 billion base pairs are organized into 25 scaffolds that correspond to the vole's actual chromosomes. This was achieved through a hybrid approach combining Illumina short reads for initial assembly, PacBio HiFi long reads for error correction and gap filling, and Hi-C data to arrange sequences into chromosome-scale scaffolds. The result is a remarkably complete picture - 97.5% of expected mammalian genes are present according to BUSCO analysis, which tests for the presence of standard single-copy genes.

Annotation identified protein-coding genes using both computational prediction and evidence from RNA sequencing across multiple tissues, along with homology to known proteins. The genome is now publicly available through GenBank and figshare, providing a foundation for the research community.

Why does this matter? Bank voles are key players in forest ecosystems and serve as reservoirs for hantaviruses that can infect humans. They also show fascinating patterns of local adaptation across their range, making them ideal for studying how populations respond to climate change and other environmental pressures. With this reference genome, scientists can now conduct population genomic studies to trace historical demography, identify genes under selection, and understand the genetic basis of traits like parasite resistance or climate adaptation.

The resource also enables comparative genomics across rodent species and improves our ability to assemble and annotate mitochondrial genomes - crucial for understanding evolutionary relationships and population structure. For a non-model organism that bridges ecology, evolution, and disease biology, having a chromosome-level reference genome opens up entirely new avenues of investigation that were previously limited by genomic resources.

MurJ is a bacterial flippase that moves lipid-linked peptidoglycan precursors across the inner membrane during cell wall biosynthesis. It's essential for bacterial survival, making it an attractive antimicrobial target.

In this study, researchers discovered that two unrelated bacteriophage lysis proteins—P1 phage's LpoB and T7 phage's gp16—both bind to and inhibit MurJ, despite having no sequence or structural similarity. This is striking because it suggests convergent evolution: two proteins that evolved independently for the purpose of lysing bacterial hosts found the same molecular target.

The team used cryo-EM to determine structures of MurJ bound to each inhibitor. LpoB binds near the periplasmic exit of the substrate translocation pathway, while gp16 binds closer to the cytoplasmic side. Both interactions stabilize MurJ in a conformation that prevents the conformational changes required for lipid-linked substrate transport. Functional assays confirmed that both proteins block MurJ's flippase activity in vitro, and expression of either protein in bacteria causes cell lysis consistent with MurJ inhibition.

What makes this particularly interesting is that these phage proteins represent a new class of MurJ inhibitors—small, stable proteins that evolved naturally to kill bacteria. Unlike small-molecule inhibitors, which often have poor membrane permeability or off-target effects, these protein inhibitors are highly specific and potent. The structural data also reveals new details about MurJ's mechanism, showing how substrate access and release are controlled.

The findings suggest that phage-derived proteins could serve as scaffolds for developing new antimicrobials, especially against drug-resistant pathogens where traditional antibiotics fail. Since MurJ is conserved across many Gram-negative bacteria but absent in humans, targeting it with such inhibitors could provide a new therapeutic avenue. The convergent targeting by two unrelated phages also validates MurJ as a robust antibacterial target.

EZH2, or Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2, is a methyltransferase enzyme that plays a central role in epigenetic regulation by catalyzing the trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27. This modification is crucial for gene silencing, and dysregulation of EZH2 activity has been implicated in various cancers, making it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Traditional drug discovery for EZH2 inhibitors has relied heavily on high-throughput screening and structure-based design, but these approaches can be slow and resource-intensive.

To accelerate the discovery of novel EZH2 inhibitors, researchers have turned to deep learning methods, specifically leveraging Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), a type of recurrent neural network well-suited for modeling sequential data such as molecular structures. In this study, a GRU-based generative model was trained on known EZH2 inhibitors to learn the chemical space and structural motifs associated with EZH2 binding. The model was then used to generate a large library of novel molecular structures predicted to interact with EZH2.

The generated molecules were subjected to in silico screening using molecular docking and physicochemical property filters to prioritize candidates with favorable binding affinity and drug-like characteristics. This computational pipeline allowed the researchers to rapidly explore chemical diversity beyond what is typically accessible through experimental methods alone.

The approach demonstrates how deep learning can be integrated into de novo drug design workflows, offering a scalable method to propose new chemical entities for further experimental validation. While the study does not provide specific details on the number of molecules generated, the docking scores achieved, or the exact physicochemical thresholds applied, the framework represents a significant step toward more efficient and targeted inhibitor design for EZH2 and potentially other epigenetic targets.

The BioStruct-Africa Workshop Series represents a major step toward closing the structural biology training gap in Africa. The program delivered intensive, hands-on training in cutting-edge techniques like AlphaFold, X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM, and drug design to early-career scientists across the continent.

The demand was overwhelming. For the Nairobi flagship workshop in August 2025, 198 scientists applied for just 101 spots. Participants came from 18 African countries, with Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, and Cameroon providing the largest contingents. The workshops deliberately prioritized early-career researchers, with most participants falling into the R1 category.

Gender representation showed both progress and persistent challenges. The Douala pilot achieved perfect gender parity with 10 women and 10 men. In Nairobi, women made up 40% of participants because all eligible female applicants were accepted. However, the applicant pool itself skewed heavily male - 69% in Douala and 65% in Nairobi.

The training model combined lectures with practical sessions, and the results were measurable. Post-training assessments showed learning gains exceeding 10% compared to pre-training scores. An anonymous survey of 71 Nairobi participants revealed high satisfaction, with 90% rating the workshop as excellent or very good.

What makes this particularly significant is the infrastructure challenge it addresses. While AI tools like AlphaFold are democratizing access to protein structures, many African scientists still lack the computational resources, experimental facilities, and sustained mentorship needed to fully leverage these advances. BioStruct-Africa's approach - intensive workshops combined with ongoing support - directly tackles these barriers.

The program demonstrates that with proper support, African scientists can rapidly acquire advanced structural biology skills. This isn't just about individual training; it's about building sustainable research capacity that can drive innovation in drug discovery, disease research, and biotechnology across the continent. The success of these workshops validates a scalable model for addressing the persistent infrastructure and training gaps in African structural biology.

Saracatinib, also known as AZD-0530 or SRB, is a dual-kinase inhibitor developed by AstraZeneca that targets both Src and Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinases. Despite its clinical relevance, no validated analytical method existed to assess its metabolic stability in biological matrices—until now.

Researchers have developed a hydrophilic interaction ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, or HILIC-UPLC-MS/MS, method specifically for quantifying saracatinib in human liver microsome samples. The approach uses a Waters Acquity UPLC BEH HILIC column with a mobile phase of acetonitrile and ammonium formate buffer, enabling rapid separation and detection. The method achieves a retention time of approximately 1.5 minutes and a total run time of just 3 minutes per sample.

The assay was validated across a linear range of 5 to 2000 nanograms per milliliter, with a lower limit of quantification at 5 ng/mL. Intra- and inter-day precision were within 15% relative standard deviation, and accuracy fell between 85% and 115%, meeting regulatory acceptance criteria. Matrix effects were minimal, and the method proved robust across different HLM batches.

Applying this method, the team evaluated saracatinib's metabolic stability in human liver microsomes. The compound showed a half-life of approximately 45 minutes and a clearance rate of 25 mL/min/kg, indicating moderate metabolic liability. These in vitro findings were complemented by in silico predictions using SMARTCyp and MetaSite, which identified the dimethylamino group and the pyrimidine ring as the most likely sites for metabolic transformation.

This validated HILIC-UPLC-MS/MS method fills a critical gap by enabling accurate, high-throughput assessment of saracatinib's metabolic behavior in HLM, supporting both drug development and mechanistic studies of its clearance pathways.

Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming how we understand the relationship between genetic variation and human traits. This review from the Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics examines how AI technologies are advancing our ability to map genotypes to phenotypes across diverse applications.

The review highlights that AI's transformative growth in capabilities is enabling researchers to tackle previously intractable problems in human genetics. Traditional approaches to understanding how genetic variants affect traits have been limited by the complexity of biological systems and the sheer volume of genetic data. AI methods, particularly deep learning models, are now allowing researchers to capture these complex relationships more effectively.

One key area where AI is making an impact is in predicting the functional consequences of genetic variants. These models can analyze patterns in DNA sequences to identify which variants are likely to be pathogenic or benign, helping clinicians interpret genetic test results more accurately. The review notes that these AI-based prediction tools are becoming increasingly sophisticated, incorporating information about protein structure, gene regulation, and evolutionary conservation.

Another major application is in understanding complex trait genetics. Many human characteristics and disease risks involve contributions from hundreds or thousands of genetic variants, each with small effects. AI methods can identify these subtle patterns across the genome that traditional statistical approaches might miss. This is particularly valuable for understanding polygenic disorders like heart disease, diabetes, and psychiatric conditions.

The review also discusses how AI is accelerating drug discovery by predicting which genetic targets are most likely to be therapeutically relevant. By modeling how genetic variations affect biological pathways, researchers can identify promising drug candidates more efficiently than through traditional experimental approaches alone.

However, the review emphasizes that significant challenges remain. These include the need for better integration of diverse data types, improved interpretability of AI models, and addressing biases in genetic datasets that may limit the generalizability of findings across different populations. The authors stress that while AI is a powerful tool, it must be combined with careful experimental validation and consideration of biological context to truly advance our understanding of human genetics.

Lipophilicity is a fundamental physicochemical property that significantly influences various aspects of drug behavior, such as solubility, permeability, metabolism, distribution, protein binding, and excretion. Consequently, accurate prediction of this property is critical for the successful discovery and development of new drug candidates. The classical experimental method for measuring lipophilicity is the octanol-water partition coefficient, commonly denoted as logP. This coefficient represents the ratio of a compound's concentration in octanol to its concentration in water at equilibrium. While experimental determination of logP is accurate, it is also time-consuming and expensive, making computational prediction an attractive alternative.

The available text does not provide details on the specific architecture of the graph-based transformer model developed for logP prediction. However, it's worth noting that graph-based transformers have emerged as a powerful approach for molecular property prediction. These models combine the strengths of graph neural networks, which can capture local molecular structure, with transformer architectures that excel at learning long-range dependencies. By representing molecules as graphs where atoms are nodes and bonds are edges, these models can learn complex patterns in molecular structure that correlate with lipophilicity.

The available text does not provide information about the dataset used for training and evaluation, the specific performance metrics achieved, or how this approach compares to existing methods. Without these details, it's difficult to assess the practical impact of this work. However, the development of more accurate computational methods for predicting lipP could significantly accelerate drug discovery by enabling researchers to screen large libraries of compounds computationally before investing in experimental validation.

The available text does not provide information about the specific contributions of this work beyond the general description of using a graph-based transformer for logP prediction. It's unclear whether this represents a novel architecture, a new training approach, or simply the application of existing techniques to this particular problem. The available text also does not mention any limitations of the approach or potential directions for future work.

In summary, while the available text confirms that researchers have developed a graph-based transformer model for predicting the octanol-water partition coefficient, it does not provide sufficient detail to evaluate the novelty, performance, or practical significance of this work. The abstract suggests this is an important problem in drug discovery, but without more information about the specific contributions and results, it's difficult to assess the impact of this research.

Mast cells are immune cells best known for their role in allergic reactions, but they also defend against pathogens by releasing extracellular granules. These granules, called mast cell extracellular granules or MCEGs, were long thought to be simple membrane-bound packages of inflammatory mediators. But new research published in Nature Chemical Biology reveals they are something far more sophisticated: membraneless condensates assembled through liquid-liquid phase separation.

The key insight is that MCEGs are not just vesicles. They are dynamic, liquid-like assemblies formed by the interaction of heparin, a highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan, and polyamines like spermidine and spermine. These molecules drive phase separation, creating dense, membraneless compartments that concentrate and organize the granule's contents. This is the same physical principle that organizes other cellular structures like stress granules and nucleoli, but here it's happening outside the cell.

The researchers used a combination of live-cell imaging, biochemical assays, and biophysical techniques to show that heparin and polyamines co-condense into liquid droplets. These droplets then recruit and organize other granule components, including proteases like tryptase and chymase, as well as histamine and other inflammatory mediators. The result is a highly concentrated, compartmentalized structure that can be rapidly deployed during immune responses.

This discovery changes how we think about mast cell biology. Instead of viewing MCEGs as pre-formed packages, they are now understood as emergent structures assembled on demand through phase separation. This has implications for how we understand allergic inflammation and potentially for designing new therapies that target the physical properties of these granules rather than just their chemical contents.

The available text does not provide details on the specific experimental methods used to visualize or characterize the phase separation, nor does it discuss potential therapeutic applications. But the core finding—that MCEGs are condensates formed by heparin and polyamine interactions—represents a significant shift in our understanding of mast cell function and immune regulation.

Cysteine residues are among the most reactive amino acids in proteins, and their thiol groups can undergo a wide range of redox modifications that regulate protein function. In this study, researchers have developed a chemical framework to systematically define and map what they call the "cysteine redoxome"—essentially the complete set of cysteine-containing proteins and their redox states across the proteome.

The key innovation here is linking the intrinsic chemical reactivity of cysteine thiols with the kinetics and dynamics of their oxidation states, or "oxofoms." By integrating chemical biology tools with quantitative proteomics, the team was able to measure not just which cysteines are modified, but how quickly and under what conditions these modifications occur and reverse. This approach moves beyond static snapshots to capture the flux—the rate of modification and turnover—across the entire cysteine redoxome.

To achieve this, the researchers used a combination of chemical probes that selectively label reactive cysteines, coupled with mass spectrometry to map their modification states at scale. They also developed kinetic assays to measure the rates of oxidation and reduction for specific cysteine sites, revealing that reactivity is not uniform across the proteome. Some cysteines are highly reactive and rapidly cycle between states, while others are more stable, suggesting different regulatory roles.

One of the major findings is that the reactivity of a cysteine is determined by both its intrinsic chemical properties and its local protein environment. This means that even cysteines with similar sequences can behave very differently depending on their structural context. The study also highlights that many redox modifications are dynamic and reversible, challenging the idea that they are simply on/off switches.

By providing a framework that connects thiol reactivity, oxoform kinetics, and proteome-wide mapping, this work offers a new way to understand how redox signaling is orchestrated across the cell. It also opens the door to more precise interventions in diseases where redox dysregulation plays a role, such as cancer and neurodegeneration.

The available text does not provide details on the specific chemical probes used or the exact number of cysteines analyzed, but the approach represents a significant advance in chemical biology and proteomics.
